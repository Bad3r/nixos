  Package: babashka
  Description: Native Clojure scripting runtime with instant startup and batteries included tooling.
  Homepage: https://babashka.org/
  Documentation: https://book.babashka.org/
  Repository: https://github.com/babashka/babashka

  Summary:
    * Executes Clojure scripts with near-instant startup, pods, and task automation via `bb.edn`.
    * Bundles a curated JVM-less standard library plus integrations for shelling out, HTTP, data processing, and more.

  Options:
    -e, --eval <expr>: Evaluate a Clojure expression directly from the command line.
    -f, --file <path>: Run a script file, resolving `bb.edn` dependencies automatically.
    -m, --main <ns|var>: Invoke a namespace's `-main` function or a fully qualified var.
    -x, --exec <var>: Execute a task-style function, parsing CLI args through babashka's CLI tooling.
    tasks: List tasks defined in the active `bb.edn` configuration.

  Example Usage:
    * `bb -e '(+ 1 2 3)'` — Evaluate an inline expression and print the result.
    * `bb -x greet --name Alice` — Call a function exported in `bb.edn` with parsed CLI options.
    * `bb tasks` — Inspect available tasks defined in the project `bb.edn` file.
