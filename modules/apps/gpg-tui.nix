  Homepage: https://github.com/orhun/gpg-tui
  Documentation: https://github.com/orhun/gpg-tui#usage
  Repository: https://github.com/orhun/gpg-tui

  Summary:
    * Presents a TUI dashboard for listing keys, signing, revoking, exporting, and editing trust without memorizing GPG CLI options.
    * Integrates with `gpg-agent` and provides search, filtering, and keyboard-driven workflows for keyring maintenance.

  Options:
    gpg-tui: Launch the interface; navigation and operations are performed with keyboard shortcuts.
    -k, --key <fingerprint>: Focus a specific key on startup.
    --lang <locale>: Choose UI language if translations are available.

  Example Usage:
    * `gpg-tui` â€” Open the TUI to manage local and imported keys interactively.
    * Within the UI, use `S` to sign a selected key or `E` to export it.
    * Press `?` inside the application to view the shortcut reference.
