  Documentation: https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#readme
  Repository: https://github.com/sharkdp/fd

  Summary:
    * Provides blazing fast recursive file search with smart case matching, regex support, and parallel traversal.
    * Integrates with fdignore/gitignore, advanced filtering, and command execution hooks for pairing with other tools.

  Options:
    --extension <ext>: Restrict matches to a file extension (e.g., `rs`, `md`).
    --type f|d|x: Filter by file, directory, or executable type.
    --exec <cmd> {} \;: Run a command for each match.
    --hidden --no-ignore: Include hidden files and disable ignore rules.

  Example Usage:
    * `fd config ~/.config` — Quickly locate configuration files under a directory tree.
    * `fd --extension rs --exec rustfmt {}` — Format all Rust files discovered by fd.
    * `fd '^Dockerfile$' --hidden --strip-cwd-prefix` — Find Dockerfiles anywhere in the repo while producing clean paths.
