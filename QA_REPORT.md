## Current Issues and Remediation Status

### ✅ Issues with Complete Solutions

1. **Input Imports (CLARIFIED - NOT AN ISSUE)**
   - **Status:** These are ALLOWED and correct
   - **Action:** No changes needed - preserve existing input imports
   
2. **nvidia-gpu Module (ALREADY CORRECT)**
   - **Status:** Current specialisation pattern matches golden standard
   - **Action:** No changes needed - already compliant

3. **Missing Patterns (WILL BE ADDED)**
   - **Missing:** input-branches, generation-manager
   - **Solution:** Complete implementation code provided in plan
   - **Timeline:** Days 2-5

4. **Module Headers (107 MISSING)**
   - **Solution:** Automated script to add headers to all modules
   - **Timeline:** Day 6

5. **TODOs (7 REMAINING)**
   - **Primary:** dnscrypt-proxy configuration
   - **Solution:** Complete configuration with bootstrap resolvers
   - **Timeline:** Day 7

6. **User Inconsistency (vx vs bad3r)**
   - **Solution:** Document that vx is username, Bad3r is display name
   - **Timeline:** Day 10

7. **Metadata Organization**
   - **Solution:** Enhanced comprehensive metadata structure
   - **Timeline:** Day 9
