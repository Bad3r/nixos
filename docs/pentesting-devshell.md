# Pentesting Dev Shell

This flake provides a dedicated pentesting development shell instead of baking the tooling directly into system profiles. Enter it with:

```bash
nix develop .#pentesting --command <tool> [args]
```

Included tools:

- burpsuite
- nmap
- wireshark
- aircrack-ng
- hydra
- john
- sqlmap
- metasploit
- hashcat

## Launcher Wrappers

Enable `pentesting-devshell` in Home Manager to install wrapper scripts (`pentest-burpsuite`, `pentest-wireshark`, etc.) that invoke the dev shell automatically:

```nix
home-manager.extraAppImports = [
  "pentesting-devshell"
];
```

The module drops `.desktop` files for Burp Suite and Wireshark, so you can launch them from graphical menus while they still run inside the dev shell. Make sure your user is in the `wireshark` group before capturing packets.

## Notes

- Heavy GUI apps stay outside the base system closure, keeping rebuilds fast while still letting you launch them on demand.
- You can add more wrappers by extending `modules/hm-apps/pentesting-devshell.nix` with additional `guiEntries` or tool names.
- Combine the shell with `nix run` or scripts for ad-hoc tasks without modifying host roles.
