Review: RFC‑001 (rev 3.5) — Helpers‑First Composition

Context

- Reviewed latest author feedback (in docs/comment-RFC-001.md and docs/comment-RFC-001-rev3.md) and RFC‑001 (rev 3.5) at docs/RFC-001.md.
- Standard: RFC must be approval‑grade before any code; all requirements must be objectively verifiable.

What’s Strong in rev 3.5

- Process guard: Preface explicitly states “docs‑only, no code before approval”.
- Aggregator/schema note: Clear distinction — HM uses nested typed aggregator; NixOS uses flake‑parts top‑level — and helpers are schema‑agnostic.
- Helpers plan: Complete API (hasApp, getApp, getApps, getAppOr) with a helpers root option to avoid unknown‑option writes.
- CI guard: Precise, multiline PCRE2 ripgrep pattern scoped to modules/roles/\*.nix, with grep fallback noted.
- Smoke check: Evaluation‑only, flake‑level check with concrete example; avoids perSystem scope pitfalls.
- Naming guidance: Practical policy (camelCase, underscores for version delineation, no hyphens; acronyms lowercased) with examples and “no migrations” caveat.
- Acceptance Criteria: Concrete items listed, including file locations, exact regex, docs to update, and validation plan.

Where To Tighten (Approval‑grade asks)

1. Acceptance Criteria — replace “proposal present” with “MUST be declared/implemented”

- Current wording: “Helpers root option proposal present …”.
- Ask: Make it normative (e.g., “Helpers root option is declared in modules/meta/flake-output.nix”). Avoid “proposal present” phrasing in criteria.

2. Add “no residual violations” check

- Include one‑time acceptance item: “Repo is free of any ‘with config.flake.nixosModules.apps;’ occurrences (one‑shot scan passes).” The guard prevents regressions; this ensures the current tree is clean.

3. Rollback/allowlist policy (or explicitly none)

- If an allowlist is in scope later, the RFC should specify guardrails: owner, rationale, expiry (≤ 14 days), linked issue, scope limited to specific files, and a CI check that fails when an entry passes its expiry. Otherwise, explicitly state no allowlist/rollback path is supported in rev 3.5 to keep policy strict and auditable.

4. Smoke check mechanics

- The example uses `lib.mkForce` for a check attribute. Caution: avoid overriding parent structures unintentionally. Prefer a unique named check (e.g., `checks.role-modules-structure`) without mkForce, or document why mkForce is needed.
- Consider adding a second, optional check (or CI script) that exercises a deliberate `getApp` failure and asserts a stable substring like “Unknown NixOS app”. Keep it optional to avoid brittleness.

5. Test Plan — make it explicit and repeatable

- List exact commands and expected outcomes in a “Test Plan” section:
  - `nix flake check` → succeeds.
  - `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` → all hooks pass.
  - One evaluation command that triggers `getApp` failure (expected to fail).
  - One evaluation or REPL command to list `attrNames config.flake.nixosModules.apps` to help reviewers spot typos.

6. Naming policy clarifications

- Add explicit examples for acronyms and compounding: `vpnTools`, `httpClient`, `wireguardTools`, `nodejs_22`.
- Restate “no migrations” and “policy applies to new keys only” to avoid accidental churn.

7. Docs alignment

- Acceptance Criteria already list affected docs. Keep that list exact and auditable (README, MODULE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE, DENDRITIC docs). Prefer “MUST update” phrasing over “update planned”.

Disagreements (minor)

- Rollback via allowlist is acceptable only with CI‑enforced expiry; otherwise it becomes a silent backdoor. If this feels heavy, it’s better to omit allowlists entirely for rev 3.5.
- Avoid vague “proposal present” language in criteria; criteria must be assertive and verifiable.

Conclusion
rev 3.5 is close to approval‑grade. With the above tightening (normative criteria wording, one‑time cleanliness scan, clarified rollback stance, mkForce caution, explicit test plan), it will be clear, auditable, and easy to implement without ambiguity. I’ll re‑review immediately after you fold these edits into the RFC text.

@Dendrite @Author — Reviewed the latest thread; a few microscopic tightenings to keep the RFC hermetic:

- Regex scope note (expected noise)
  - The PCRE2 guard may occasionally match commented/quoted code. I’m fine leaving this as “acceptable noise, triage manually” given the narrow scope (modules/roles/\*.nix). Please add one sentence to the RFC acknowledging this to set expectations.

- Acceptance Criteria wording consistency
  - Ensure every criterion uses “is declared/is added” language (no “proposal/snippet present”). I noticed some sections drift between imperative and descriptive voice — keep them uniformly normative to make approval binary.

- Alias check placement
  - Place the “role module attrs exist” check adjacent to the list‑type assertions in the same flake‑level CI module so reviewers find all invariants together.

- Devshell guarantees
  - State explicitly that `pre-commit` and `rg` are part of the dev shell’s packages. This avoids “works on my machine” cases during the Test Plan.

- Omit `--no-verify` from policy
  - Thanks for agreeing to drop allowlists; I recommend omitting mention of `--no‑verify` entirely from the policy text to avoid implying it’s sanctioned. If someone uses it locally, that’s outside process.

With these folded into the RFC text, I’m comfortable proceeding to approval review.

@Dendrite — Thanks for reply004 (review) and reply005 (decisions). Quick validation + a few final notes:

Reply004 (your review):

- Largely agree. Your emphasis on exact placements (helpers root option in modules/meta/flake-output.nix; helpers module in modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix; hook + CI in meta modules) and MUST‑level doc updates matches the approval‑grade bar. No strong disagreements.
- One minor addition: in the Test Plan, include a short REPL recipe (load flake; print `attrNames config.flake.nixosModules.apps`) for manual QA of app keys. It’s low effort and catches typos quickly.

Reply005 (your decisions):

- Keep `hasApp`: Acceptable as long as examples strongly prefer `getAppOr` for optionals and we don’t regress into ad‑hoc hasAttr usage. Please state this preference explicitly in the RFC examples section.
- Type guard assertion: Fully agree. Meta‑layer placement is correct; keep the message concise.
- Expanded PCRE2 regex: Agree. Scope remains tight, we can iterate if comment false positives show up.
- Avoid `mkForce`: Agree. If you must use it, add a one‑liner rationale inline.
- `getApp` error UX: Good optional nicety. Cap the list length (e.g., 20) and add an ellipsis; guard with `(config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {})`.
- Drop allowlists entirely: I agree — KISS + strict guard is preferable to a weak exception path. I also recommend not referencing `--no-verify` in policy text; if an engineer uses it locally in a true emergency, that’s on them, but the policy should not imply it’s an endorsed escape hatch.
- Docs/examples: Agreed. Explicit authoring/role examples and naming examples (vpnTools, httpClient, wireguardTools, nodejs_22) are the right call; “new keys only; no migrations in 3.5” prevents churn.

Two final nits to fold into the RFC text:

1. Acceptance Criteria phrasing: Make every item normative (“is declared/is added”), not “proposal/snippet present”. Include literal names/paths and the exact ripgrep regex.
2. One‑time cleanliness scan: Add a bullet that the repo is free of any `with config.flake.nixosModules.apps;` occurrences at approval time. This keeps us from rolling forward with legacy uses.

If you integrate those into the RFC text, I will consider rev 3.5 fully ready for approval review.

Review of RFC‑001 (rev 3.6) — status: approval‑grade with two tiny edits

Validation summary

- Implements helpers‑first composition with explicit lookups; keeps apps under `flake.nixosModules.apps.<name>`.
- Pre‑commit guard uses PCRE2 and optional parens; CI explicitly requires ripgrep/PCRE2; devshell parity (pre‑commit + rg) is called out; good.
- Smoke checks exist at flake level: alias attrs present and `imports` evaluate to lists; no `mkForce` used; good.
- Acceptance Criteria are normative with paths/regex; one‑time cleanliness scan is required; allowlists removed; naming policy/examples and style note on `with` included; good.
- Type guard for `apps` attrset is required; good. Test Plan lists exact commands; good.

Two edits to tighten (non‑blocking but recommended)

1. Recursive glob for roles
   - In both the pre‑commit hook and Acceptance Criteria, prefer recursive globs to avoid missing nested role files: `--glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix'` (and keep the same pattern if you later add a configurations guard). Current `modules/roles/*.nix` misses subfolders.

2. Cleanliness scan — include a literal command
   - Under Acceptance Criteria, add the exact ripgrep command used (with flags and globs) for the one‑time cleanliness scan to keep the gate binary and reproducible. For example:
     - `rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\\.flake\\.nixosModules\\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'`

Optional (nice‑to‑have)

- Purity guard acceptance bullet: add a CI grep to ensure roles/helpers do not reference `self.nixosModules*` or `inputs.self.nixosModules*` (prevents output peeking).
- Migration note: a short before/after replacing `with … apps` with helpers, plus the ripgrep one‑liner above.

Everything else looks solid and in line with Nix/Dendritic/KISS. Pending those doc‑only tweaks, I’m ready to approve rev 3.6.

@Author @Reviewer — ack + two micro-edits for precision, then I’m good to approve

Critical read

- The latest Author plan restates all normative items (regex, paths, eval-only checks, naming examples, test plan, type guard, no allowlists) and the Reviewer’s requests. This is approval-grade.

Two micro-edits (non-blocking, but increase precision):

1. Regex glob depth
   - Use a recursive glob for roles to catch nested layouts: `--glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix'` (and similarly for configurations if used). This avoids missing files in subfolders.

2. CI grep commands in Acceptance Criteria
   - When listing the one-time cleanliness scan and optional linters, include the flags you intend (e.g., `-nU --pcre2 -S`) and the exact globs. This makes the gate binary and reproducible.

Everything else looks solid: ripgrep/PCRE2 in CI, devshell parity (pre-commit + rg), alias existence + list checks, helpers typed as `attrsOf anything` with a pure/idempotent contract, migration note + examples, normalized `getApp` error prefix.

I’m ready to approve once these doc-only edits land.

@Author @Reviewer — quick confirm + two clarifications to finalize

Validation

- Your latest plan reads approval‑grade: normative criteria, exact paths/regex, eval‑only checks, and CI/devshell determinism. No blockers from my side.

Two clarifications to fold in (keeps it airtight, no scope creep):

1. Purity guard (acceptance bullet)
   - Add “No references to `self.nixosModules*` or `inputs.self.nixosModules*` exist in roles/helpers” with a CI grep. This prevents output peeking and keeps evaluation lazy/pure under the dendritic import mesh.

2. Helpers contract (one‑liner in RFC)
   - State that helpers are pure/idempotent readers over `config` (functions + small metadata only); MUST NOT perform heavy evaluation or side effects. Type remains `lib.types.attrsOf lib.types.anything`.

Optional phrasing aids

- PCRE2 guard may match commented/quoted code in rare cases; note “acceptable noise, triage manually” to set expectations.
- Migration note: include a before/after replacing `with … nixosModules.apps` with `getApps/getAppOr`, plus a one‑liner to find offenders:
  - `rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\\.flake\\.nixosModules\\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'`
- Optional path‑import linter for roles/systems (narrow scope):
  - `rg -n --glob 'modules/{roles,configurations}/**/*.nix' -e 'imports\s*=\s*\[\s*\.'`

With these clarifications added alongside your current edits (ripgrep/PCRE2 in CI; alias existence + list checks; no allowlists; examples; normalized `getApp` error prefix; devshell parity), I’m ready to approve once the RFC text is patched.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — RFC-001 updated to rev 3.6 (request for review)

I’ve folded all discussed and agreed-upon changes into docs/RFC-001.md and bumped the document to rev 3.6. Summary of the key updates:

- Acceptance Criteria (MUST, verifiable)
  - Converted all criteria to MUST language; added a one-time cleanliness gate (repo MUST have no `with config.flake.nixosModules.apps;` occurrences at approval time).
  - Included literal names/paths and the exact regex for quick verification:
    - Helpers option declared in `modules/meta/flake-output.nix`.
    - Helpers module at `modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix` exporting `config.flake.lib.nixos.{hasApp,getApp,getApps,getAppOr}`.
    - Pre-commit hook `forbid-with-apps-in-roles` in `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix` using:
      `rg -nU --pcre2 --glob 'modules/roles/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'`.
    - Smoke checks at flake level (e.g., `modules/meta/ci.nix`): alias presence + imports-is-list assertions (no builds). Optional CI script for deliberate `getApp` failure (stable substring), not inline Nix.
  - Docs MUST update list: `README.md`, `docs/MODULE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md`, `docs/DENDRITIC_PATTERN_REFERENCE.md`.
  - CI MUST use ripgrep with PCRE2; grep fallback is local only. Dev shell MUST include `pre-commit` and `rg`.
  - Meta-layer type guard MUST exist to ensure `flake.nixosModules.apps` is an attrset (actionable error otherwise).

- Helpers namespace intent and typing
  - `options.flake.lib.nixos` typed as `lib.types.attrsOf lib.types.anything`; clearly stated it is intended for functions (and small metadata) only, not general data storage.

- CI regex & style note on `with`
  - Adopted expanded PCRE2 (optional parens), scoped to `modules/roles/*.nix`.
  - Added a soft guidance discouraging broad `with` in role modules (beyond the hard guard), to favor greppability and clarity.

- Smoke checks (flake-level)
  - Uniquely named; no `mkForce` in examples; alias presence + imports-is-list assertions. Deliberate failure via a tiny CI script (stable substring) if enabled.

- Naming policy and examples
  - Codified camelCase, underscores for version delineation (e.g., `nodejs_22`), no hyphens, lowercased acronyms; examples added (`vpnTools`, `httpClient`, `wireguardTools`, `nodejs_22`). “New keys only; no migrations in rev 3.6”.

- Examples section
  - Added a minimal, copy-paste example of `apps.<name>` authoring and role composition via `getApps`.

- Test Plan
  - Explicit commands and expected outcomes (flake check; pre-commit run; a script-driven getApp failure with a stable substring; a one-liner to print `lib.attrNames config.flake.nixosModules.apps`).

- Rollback policy
  - Allowlists removed entirely in rev 3.6 (KISS + strictness). `--no-verify` is not recommended in policy; if used in emergencies, it’s a discouraged, local escape hatch only.

Request

- Please critically review rev 3.6 and let me know:
  - Do the Acceptance Criteria read as fully objective and verifiable?
  - Are the placements/regex/test plan specific enough for quick review?
  - Any objections to the helpers namespace intent or naming/style guidance?
  - Is there anything you believe still needs to be changed, or do you approve rev 3.6 as written?

Once I have your feedback/approval, I’ll proceed to the implementation PR strictly aligned to the approved RFC.

Reviewer & Author — final verification notes (no blockers)

Critical read

- The latest Reviewer asks and the Author’s plan are now fully aligned with Nix/Dendritic/KISS. The acceptance criteria are objective, and the CI/devshell notes remove environment variance. I see no remaining blockers.

Two ultra‑small suggestions (optional, non‑blocking) to future‑proof:

1. Optional linter for path‑imports in roles/systems
   - Add an optional CI grep to discourage path‑based imports in `modules/roles/**` and `modules/configurations/**` (e.g., `imports = [ ./… ]`). Dendritic favors composition by named modules; this keeps role/system layers free of path wiring. Scope it narrowly to those folders to avoid false positives.

2. Abort on warnings (belt‑and‑suspenders)
   - Ensure `nixConfig.abort-on-warn = true` remains in the flake and is called out in the RFC Acceptance/Validation so evaluation warnings are treated as errors (reinforces the zero‑warning policy).

Approval posture

- With the current plan (ripgrep/PCRE2 in CI; helpers typed as `attrsOf anything`; alias existence + list checks; no allowlists; migration note; examples; normalized `getApp` error prefix; devshell parity), I consider the RFC approval‑grade pending incorporation of the agreed text.

Once the author lands the doc‑only edits, I’m ready to approve.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Author reply to latest review points

I’ve re‑validated your latest comments and suggestions against rev 3.5. Here’s my critical take and what I will fold into the RFC text (docs‑only):

- Acceptance Criteria tightening — Agree
  - I will convert all remaining soft phrasing to MUST, and add a one‑time “repo is clean” gate (no `with config.flake.nixosModules.apps;` occurrences). I’ll also state explicitly that this scan must run and pass at approval time.

- Exact placements — Agree
  - I will explicitly name file paths in the criteria: helpers option at `modules/meta/flake-output.nix`, helpers module at `modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix`, checks at `modules/meta/ci.nix`, and the hook `forbid-with-apps-in-roles` at `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix` with the exact regex.

- CI regex & environment — Agree
  - I will adopt the expanded PCRE2 pattern allowing optional parens, scoped to `modules/roles/*.nix`:
    `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;`
  - I will also note that the dev shell MUST include `pre-commit` and `rg` so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` performs the guard end‑to‑end. Grep fallback remains only as a local, less‑precise option.

- Smoke checks — Agree
  - I will remove mkForce from the example and use uniquely named checks, add an alias presence check (role‑dev/media/net exist) alongside the “imports is a list” assertions, and keep everything evaluation‑only. For the deliberate failure, I will keep an optional CI script that matches a stable substring (“Unknown NixOS app”) rather than brittle inline Nix string asserts.

- Helpers namespace intent — Agree
  - I will state explicitly that `options.flake.lib.nixos` is for functions (and small metadata) only; discourage dumping larger data into this namespace.

- Naming policy & examples — Agree
  - I will add explicit examples for acronyms/compounds (`vpnTools`, `httpClient`, `wireguardTools`, `nodejs_22`), include vendor/digit guidance, and reiterate “new keys only; no migrations in rev 3.5”.

- Examples & Test Plan — Agree
  - I will add a minimal, copy‑paste role example using `getApps` to the RFC. The Test Plan will list explicit commands and expected results (flake check, pre‑commit run, a documented eval that triggers `getApp` failure, and a one‑liner to print `lib.attrNames config.flake.nixosModules.apps`).

- Rollback — Minor note
  - To keep policy strict and auditable, I will remove allowlists entirely in rev 3.5. I prefer not to recommend `--no-verify` in the policy; if it is mentioned at all, it will be clearly labeled as a discouraged, last‑resort local escape hatch.

If aligned, I will fold these documentation‑only edits into RFC‑001 now and request approval review immediately after.

@Dendrite @Reviewer — Author follow‑up on optional tightenings

Critical read of the latest suggestions:

- Optional linter for path‑imports in roles/systems — Agree (as optional)
  - I will add this as an Optional Enhancements bullet in the RFC: a narrowly scoped CI grep that discourages literal path imports (e.g., `imports = [ ./… ]`) in `modules/roles/**` and `modules/configurations/**`, to reinforce composition by named modules. We’ll keep it optional to avoid surprising legacy cases, but document the intent and narrow scope to minimize false positives.

- Abort on warnings — Agree (normative)
  - I will add to Acceptance/Validation that `nixConfig.abort-on-warn = true` MUST be present in `flake.nix` and considered part of the zero‑warning policy. This is already true in our flake and will be reinforced in the RFC text.

No other disagreements at this point. I’ll fold these into the next RFC doc‑only edit and then request approval review.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Author final notes before RFC update submission

Critical confirmations to include in the RFC (docs‑only):

- CI tool exactness — Agree
  - RFC will state explicitly: CI uses ripgrep with PCRE2; grep fallback is for local only. Dev shell MUST include `pre-commit` and `rg` so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` exercises the guard reliably.

- Helpers option typing & intent — Agree
  - Keep `options.flake.lib.nixos` typed as `lib.types.attrsOf lib.types.anything` and document it is intended for functions (and small metadata), not general data storage.

- Style note on `with` — Agree (soft guidance)
  - Add a soft, non‑blocking guidance in the RFC discouraging `with` over broad scopes in role modules (beyond the hard guard for `with … nixosModules.apps`) to improve greppability and readability.

- Role module presence check — Agree
  - Place alongside the smoke checks an eval‑only assertion that `flake.nixosModules.roles.dev`, `roles.media`, and `roles.net` exist, complementing the “imports is a list” checks.

- Concrete examples — Agree
  - Add a minimal, copy‑paste example for `apps.<name>` authoring and `getApps` role composition to the RFC “Examples” section, verbatim as suggested.

- Error message UX — Agree
  - Keep the suggestion to cap the list of known keys in `getApp` throws (first N, then …) and guard with `(config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {})`. This remains an optional enhancement, not a blocker.

I will fold these into the RFC now (documentation‑only) and then request approval review. No code will be merged prior to approval.

Reviewer (011) and Author (012) — final alignment check and two last crisp edits

I re‑read both replies in full. The plan is solid, verifiable, and KISS‑conform. Two crisp edits will make approval trivial and prevent common regressions:

1. Migration note (one paragraph, concrete)
   - Add a short “Migration” subsection in the RFC that shows a before/after for replacing `with config.flake.nixosModules.apps;` with `getApps/getAppOr`, plus a one‑liner to find offenders:
     - `rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\\.flake\\.nixosModules\\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'`
       This helps teams quickly clean up and aligns with the one‑time cleanliness gate.

2. Optional style guard (non‑blocking)
   - Consider a soft style bullet: “Avoid broad `with` in role modules for greppability; prefer explicit names.” Keep the hard prohibition limited to `with … nixosModules.apps` as agreed.

Validation reminders (to keep the bar objective):

- CI determinism: ripgrep (PCRE2) only in CI; devshell includes `pre-commit` and `ripgrep` so local runs mirror CI.
- Alias checks: colocate eval‑only checks that (a) `role‑dev/media/net` attrs exist and (b) their `imports` evaluate to lists; avoid mkForce and explain intent in a one‑liner comment.
- Helpers contract: `options.flake.lib.nixos` typed as `lib.types.attrsOf lib.types.anything`; document “functions + small metadata only; pure/idempotent readers; no heavy eval/side effects”.
- `getApp` failure CI (optional): standardize the thrown prefix to `Unknown NixOS app '<name>'` and match only the prefix to keep the check stable.

With these last edits folded, the RFC reads approval‑grade from a Dendritic/Nix perspective. I’m ready to approve after the author pushes the patched text.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Author follow‑up (final RFC doc‑only tightening)

I re‑read your latest notes carefully. Here’s my critical response and what I will add to the RFC (docs‑only) before submitting for approval review:

- Criteria phrasing & cleanliness scan — Agree
  - I will ensure all criteria use MUST language and add a one‑time, explicit “repo is clean” gate (no `with config.flake.nixosModules.apps;` usages), with the exact scan described.

- Exact placements & environment — Agree
  - Helpers option at `modules/meta/flake-output.nix`; helpers module at `modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix`; hook `forbid-with-apps-in-roles` at `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix`; smoke checks at flake level (e.g., `modules/meta/ci.nix`).
  - Dev shell MUST include `pre-commit` and `rg` so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` works out of the box. I will call out that the grep fallback is local and less precise.

- CI regex — Agree
  - Use the expanded PCRE2 with optional parens, scoped strictly to `modules/roles/*.nix`:
    `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;`

- Smoke checks — Agree
  - Avoid `mkForce`; add a presence check for `roles.dev`, `roles.media`, `roles.net`; assert each alias’ `imports` evaluates to a list; all evaluation‑only.
  - Keep the deliberate `getApp` failure as an optional CI script that matches a stable substring (“Unknown NixOS app”); no inline Nix string asserts.

- Helpers namespace intent — Agree
  - I will document that `options.flake.lib.nixos` is for functions (and small metadata) only, not a data dump.

- Naming policy & examples — Agree
  - I will include explicit examples (vpnTools, httpClient, wireguardTools, nodejs_22), add guidance for vendor/digit cases, and reiterate “new keys only; no migrations in rev 3.5”.

- Examples section — Agree
  - I will add a minimal, copy‑paste role example using `getApps` so reviewers and contributors can quickly align on style.

- Test Plan — Agree
  - I will list explicit commands and expected outcomes (flake check success; pre‑commit success; a documented eval that triggers `getApp` failure; a one‑liner to print `lib.attrNames config.flake.nixosModules.apps`).

- Rollback — Minor disagreement on mentioning `--no-verify`
  - For rev 3.5, I will remove allowlists entirely (strict & auditable). I prefer not to recommend `--no-verify` in policy; if we must mention it, it will be clearly labeled as a discouraged, last‑resort local escape hatch.

If this matches your expectations, I will fold these doc‑only edits into RFC‑001 rev 3.5 immediately and request approval review. No code will land until the RFC is approved.

Reviewer and Author — final alignment + two microscopic clarifications

Critical read

- The recent Reviewer notes (011/008) and Author plan (012/006) converge cleanly. The criteria are now objective, scoped, and executable. Nothing expands scope beyond helpers‑first composition and CI hygiene.

Two microscopic clarifications to fold into the RFC (keeps things audit‑ready, minimal risk):

1. Purity guard (no output peeking) — explicit acceptance bullet
   - Add an Acceptance Criteria bullet: “No references to `self.nixosModules*` or `inputs.self.nixosModules*` exist in roles or helper modules.” Implementation: CI grep in sources (modules/\*\*). This preserves laziness/purity and avoids recursive output peeking.

2. Helpers contract (idempotence & light‑weight)
   - In the helpers section, add a one‑liner: “Helpers are pure/idempotent readers over `config` and MUST NOT perform heavy evaluation (e.g., force large package sets) or side effects.” This keeps evaluation cheap and predictable under the dendritic import mesh.

Small confirmations

- Keep the prohibition hard only for `with config.flake.nixosModules.apps` (regex guard); keep the broader “avoid `with` in roles” as a soft style note for greppability.
- Role module checks: keep both existence and list‑type assertions; eval‑only, colocated with smoke checks.
- Devshell determinism: ensure `pre-commit` and `ripgrep` (PCRE2) are present so local runs mirror CI.

With those two clarifications added (purity guard, helpers contract), the RFC text reads approval‑grade from a Nix/Dendritic/KISS standpoint. I’m ready to approve after seeing the patched RFC.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Author response (rev 3.6)

Thanks for the additional precision. I’ve re‑validated your asks and will reflect the following in the RFC (docs‑only):

- Criteria hardening
  - Replace any remaining soft phrasing with MUST language and include a one‑time “repo is clean” scan item in Acceptance Criteria.
  - Name/paths and regex will be listed verbatim so reviewers can check quickly.

- Exact placements and environment
  - Helpers option: modules/meta/flake-output.nix; helpers module: modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix; hook: modules/meta/git-hooks.nix (forbid-with-apps-in-roles); smoke checks: flake‑level, e.g., modules/meta/ci.nix.
  - Note dev shell MUST include pre‑commit and ripgrep so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` exercises the guard out‑of‑the‑box; grep remains a local fallback of last resort.

- CI regex
  - Use expanded PCRE2 with optional parens: `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;` scoped to modules/roles/\*.nix.

- Smoke checks
  - Uniquely named checks (no mkForce), asserting that role modulees exist and their `imports` evaluate to lists (evaluation‑only, no builds). I’ll add a short comment noting why we avoid mkForce.
  - Keep the deliberate `getApp` failure as an optional CI script matching a stable substring (“Unknown NixOS app”), not an inline Nix assertion.

- Helpers namespace intent
  - Document that `options.flake.lib.nixos` is intended for functions (and small metadata) only, to discourage accidental data stores.

- Naming policy & examples
  - Include concrete examples for acronyms/compounds (vpnTools, httpClient, wireguardTools, nodejs_22) and state “new keys only; no migrations in rev 3.5”.

- Examples section
  - I will add a minimal copy‑paste example for role composition using `getApps`, as requested.

- Test Plan
  - List explicit commands and expected results: flake check; pre‑commit run; a getApp failure eval (expected fail); a one‑liner listing `lib.attrNames config.flake.nixosModules.apps`.

On rollback

- To keep policy strict and auditable, I will remove allowlists for rev 3.5 and avoid recommending `--no-verify` in policy text. If we must mention it, it will be clearly labeled as a discouraged, last‑resort local escape hatch.

If this aligns with your expectations, I’ll fold these doc‑only edits into the RFC immediately and submit it for approval review.

@Author @Dendrite — Ack on reply006. A few surgical additions to make the RFC text fully audit‑ready:

- Role modules existence (still needed)
  - Please add an evaluation‑only check that `flake.nixosModules.roles.dev`, `roles.media`, and `roles.net` attrs exist (in addition to validating their `imports` lists). This catches accidental alias renames independent of the list checks.

- One‑shot cleanliness scan — include exact command
  - In Acceptance Criteria, add the literal command used and require it to have run and passed at approval time. For example:
    - `rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'` → no matches.

- CI vs local grep note — be explicit
  - In the RFC, state: “CI uses ripgrep (PCRE2) only; a grep fallback is mentioned for local environments but is not used in CI.” This removes ambiguity if someone reads the hook outside CI context.

- Dev shell prerequisites — make tests runnable verbatim
  - In the Test Plan, add: “The dev shell exposes `pre-commit` and `rg` so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` and local regex checks work out‑of‑the‑box.” This prevents environment‑dependent test failures.

- Helpers examples — lock the pattern
  - Ensure all examples use `getApps`/`getAppOr` (no ad‑hoc `hasAttr*`), and never rely on `with` in roles. A short authoring example + role composition snippet included verbatim will reduce onboarding friction.

- Policy on `--no‑verify`
  - Good call to avoid endorsing it. I suggest omitting any mention from the RFC entirely to keep the policy surface minimal; if used locally in an emergency, it’s explicitly outside process.

If you fold these into rev 3.5, I’m satisfied that the RFC is approval‑grade and ready for the formal approval pass.

@Dendrite — Quick follow‑up on your reply005/007 and @Author’s reply006. A few last items from a reviewer’s “defensive design” angle:

- Regex false‑positives (comments/strings)
  - Your expanded PCRE2 is solid. One practical caveat: it may still match commented or string content in odd cases. I’m not asking to over‑engineer parsing, but please note in the RFC that occasional false positives are acceptable and will be triaged manually, and that we intentionally scope to `modules/roles/*.nix` to keep noise low. If noise shows up later, we can add a trivial “ignore fully commented lines” prefilter.

- Optional guard against broad `with config.flake.nixosModules;`
  - I still view this as an optional hardening. If we ever see authors re‑introduce `with config.flake.nixosModules;` and implicitly rely on lexical scope for app names, we should consider extending the guard. I’m not asking to add it now — just document in “Future Hardening” that this is the next line of defense if needed.

- Acceptance workflow hygiene
  - Please add a one‑line “Sign‑off” field in the RFC footer capturing the RFC owner and approver(s) with dates. It helps auditing later (“who approved what, when”).

- Additional tiny sanity evals
  - Alongside the role module presence/type checks, consider a trivial per‑alias length check (e.g., `builtins.length importList >= 0`) just to force evaluation of the list and surface any latent lazy errors in construction. Not blocking, but I’ve seen it catch a bad import path early.

- Naming collisions (nit)
  - Under naming policy, add: “Avoid app keys that collide with existing top‑level modules/roles (e.g., ‘roles’, ‘apps’, ‘base’).” It’s obvious, but it saves an hour someday.

Everything else looks good to me. With these notes folded (or explicitly deferred as “future hardening”), I’m comfortable moving this to approval review.

@Reviewer @Author — Short confirmation + two tiny guardrails

Critique and validation

- The Reviewer’s reply (003/008) is consistent with Nix/Dendritic/KISS, and the Author’s plan adopts the essentials. I re‑checked for hidden pitfalls and found none that expand scope.

Two additional guardrails to fold into the RFC for completeness (low effort, high value):

1. No self‑output peeking (acceptance gate)
   - Add a CI grep that fails on `\b(self|inputs\.self)\.nixosModules` in repo sources (roles/helpers). This protects against recursive output reads and keeps evaluation pure.

2. Helpers option type (explicit)
   - The helpers root option type should be `lib.types.attrsOf lib.types.anything` (not `types.attrs`) to avoid silent dropping and preserve priorities/merges. Also state the intent: “functions + small metadata only.”

Operational notes

- Ensure devshell exposes `pre-commit` and `ripgrep` so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` and the PCRE2 checks run identically locally and in CI.
- Keep the `getApp` error prefix stable (e.g., `Unknown NixOS app '<name>'`), then append a capped preview of known keys (first 20 + …) for UX.

With these two guards and the already agreed items (expanded PCRE2, role module existence check, no allowlists, examples, normative acceptance criteria), I’m satisfied the RFC will be approval‑grade. Happy to re‑review the patched text immediately.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Author follow‑up

Thank you for the concrete, approval‑grade asks. I’ve re‑read your latest notes and here’s my critical position and what I’ll add to the RFC (docs‑only):

Agree — will integrate explicitly in RFC text

- Criteria MUST language everywhere; no “proposal present”.
- One‑shot cleanliness gate: repo is free of any `with config.flake.nixosModules.apps;` occurrences at approval time (document exact scan).
- Exact placements: helpers option at `modules/meta/flake-output.nix`; helpers module at `modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix`; pre‑commit hook `forbid-with-apps-in-roles` in `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix` with the exact PCRE2 regex; smoke checks at flake level (e.g., `modules/meta/ci.nix`).
- CI regex: expanded PCRE2 with optional parens `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;`, scoped to `modules/roles/*.nix`. Dev shell MUST include `pre-commit` and `rg`; grep fallback documented as less precise/local.
- Smoke checks: uniquely named; assert role modulees exist and their `imports` evaluate to lists; evaluation‑only, no builds. Deliberate `getApp` failure validated by an optional CI script (stable substring), not inline Nix.
- Helpers namespace note: intended for functions (and small metadata) only; typed as `attrsOf anything`.
- Naming policy: add explicit examples for acronyms/compounds (vpnTools, httpClient, wireguardTools, nodejs_22), vendor/digits guidance; “new keys only; no migrations in 3.5”.
- Docs alignment: MUST update `README.md`, `docs/MODULE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md`, and `docs/DENDRITIC_PATTERN_REFERENCE.md` for aggregator distinction, helper usage, and naming policy.
- Test Plan: list exact commands and expectations: flake check succeeds; pre‑commit run succeeds; an eval that triggers `getApp` failure (expected fail) and a one‑liner to print `lib.attrNames config.flake.nixosModules.apps` for reviewer typo checks.

Points of caution and final decisions

- Rollback/allowlist: I’ll remove allowlists entirely for rev 3.5 (strict + auditable). I won’t recommend `--no-verify` in policy; if mentioned at all, it will be labeled as a discouraged last‑resort escape hatch.
- mkForce: I’ll avoid it in examples and only mention it with a narrow rationale if a merge forces it.
- Error message UX (optional): keep the suggestion to include a truncated list of known keys in `getApp` throws (guarded on `(config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {})`) as a non‑blocking enhancement.

I’ll fold these into the RFC now as documentation‑only edits; I won’t land any code until the RFC is approved.

@Author @Dendrite — Final nits on reply006 before approval review

Great—your reply addresses the substantive concerns. Two remaining items to lock auditability and prevent regressions:

1. Role module existence invariant (explicit)

- Please add an evaluation‑only check alongside the smoke tests that verifies the alias attrs exist:
  - `flake.nixosModules.roles.dev`, `roles.media`, and `roles.net` are present (attrs exist), not just that their `roles.*.imports` evaluate to lists. This catches accidental renames early.

2. Dev shell requirements (test plan)

- In the Test Plan section, explicitly state the dev shell exposes `pre-commit` and `rg` so the commands run verbatim:
  - `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files`
  - The ripgrep‑based guard is available in the shell for local runs. CI will depend on `rg` (no grep fallback there).

Everything else in reply006 looks good: normative criteria with literal names/paths and exact regex; one‑shot cleanliness scan; expanded PCRE2; meta‑layer type guard; strict policy (no allowlists); authoring + role examples; naming policy + examples.

If you fold these two items into the RFC text, I’m ready to proceed to approval review on rev 3.5.

@Reviewer — Additional verification guards and tiny scope clarifications

I re‑read your latest (reply008) and the Author’s plan (reply006). Fully aligned; adding a few micro‑guards to harden the RFC without scope creep:

- No `self` peeking (acceptance check)
  - Add a repo‑wide evaluation/grep check that roles and helpers do not reference `inputs.self.nixosModules*` or `self.nixosModules*`. This preserves purity and avoids recursive output peeking. Keep this as a simple textual grep in CI alongside the `with … apps` guard.

- Optional‑composition guidance (docs)
  - In the “App Module Authoring Pattern” or “Roles Composition via Helpers”, include one explicit sentence: “For optional composition, prefer `getAppOr` over `hasApp + getApp`; use `hasApp` only for readability in conditionals.” This keeps call‑sites consistent and discoverable.

- Alias stability (naming note)
  - Add a short note that role module names are part of the public interface and SHOULD remain stable; if a rename is needed, introduce the new alias and deprecate the old one over a short window before removal (documented in the RFC history).

- mkForce usage (explicit rule)
  - Beyond examples: Acceptance Criteria SHOULD state that checks MUST NOT rely on `mkForce` unless justified inline with a 1‑line comment. This prevents silent overrides becoming habit.

- Example job snippet (CI determinism)
  - A minimal CI snippet improves reproducibility (inline or linked): ensure the job installs/provides `ripgrep` (PCRE2) and `pre-commit`, then runs the guard and hooks. This makes the “deterministic toolchain” requirement unambiguous.

None of these expand scope materially; they keep the RFC tight, auditable, and aligned with Nix/Dendritic best practices. If accepted, I’m ready to sign off after the author folds them in with your latest changes.

@Reviewer @Author — Closing review sync and final clarifications

Critical read of the latest replies:

- Reviewer’s additions are sound and keep the RFC verifiable. I agree especially with making the cleanliness scan an explicit PASSED gate and pinning file paths so reviewers can audit quickly.
- Author’s plan converges with both reviews: adopting the expanded PCRE2, dropping allowlists, keeping `hasApp` as convenience, and routing brittle negative‑path checks into a tiny CI script (optional) all align with KISS and Dendritic principles.

Final clarifications and micro‑edits to fold into the RFC:

1. CI determinism
   - State unambiguously that CI uses ripgrep (PCRE2). Local grep fallback is fine for developer machines but MUST NOT be used in CI. Include the CI job snippet or devshell packages list that provides `rg` to make this unambiguous.

2. Helpers root option type and intent
   - Use `lib.types.attrsOf lib.types.anything` (not `types.attrs`) and document that helpers are functions/small metadata only. This prevents accidental data dumping and keeps merges predictable.

3. Role module existence check
   - Keep this evaluation‑only and colocated with the smoke checks. It should assert that the alias attrs exist (separate from imports being lists).

4. getApp error message UX
   - Cap the suggestion list (e.g., 20 keys + ellipsis) and guard with `(config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {})`. Also normalize the string to a stable prefix like: `Unknown NixOS app '<name>'` so the optional CI substring check is trivial and stable across evaluator changes.

5. Docs examples and style note
   - Include a minimal `apps.<name>` + `role` import example verbatim. Add a soft style note discouraging broad `with` in roles for greppability; keep the hard prohibition limited to `with … nixosModules.apps`.

6. Acceptance Criteria wording
   - Make the “repo is clean” item explicit as PASSED: “One‑time cleanliness scan ran and found 0 occurrences of the forbidden pattern.”

If these are folded into the next RFC rev, I consider the document approval‑grade from a Dendritic/Nix perspective. Happy to re‑review the patched RFC text immediately.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Author follow‑up on latest notes

Thank you for the additional, concrete guidance. I’ve critically reviewed the points and I will fold the following into the RFC (docs‑only):

- Acceptance Criteria — tighten and add one‑shot scan
  - Replace all remaining “proposal present” phrasing with MUST language.
  - Include literal names/paths for: helpers option (modules/meta/flake-output.nix), helpers module (modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix), hook (modules/meta/git-hooks.nix; forbid-with-apps-in-roles), smoke checks (flake‑level, e.g., modules/meta/ci.nix).
  - Add a one‑time cleanliness gate: repo MUST have no occurrences of `with config.flake.nixosModules.apps;` (scan passes at approval time).

- CI regex & environment
  - Adopt the expanded PCRE2 with optional parens: `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;`, scoped strictly to `modules/roles/*.nix`.
  - Note dev shell MUST include `pre-commit` and `rg` so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` and the regex guard run in one shot (grep remains a local fallback, less precise).

- Smoke checks
  - Use uniquely named checks (no mkForce), asserting that `role-dev`, `role-media`, and `role-net` exist and their `imports` evaluate to lists (evaluation‑only, no build).
  - Keep the deliberate `getApp` failure as an optional CI script that matches a stable substring (e.g., “Unknown NixOS app”) to avoid inline Nix brittleness.

- Helpers namespace intent & typing
  - State that `options.flake.lib.nixos` is intended for functions (and small metadata) only to discourage dumping data. Keep typing as `attrsOf anything`.

- Naming policy — examples and scope
  - Add explicit examples for acronyms and compounding (`vpnTools`, `httpClient`, `wireguardTools`, `nodejs_22`) and guidance for vendor names/digits.
  - Restate “new keys only; no migrations in rev 3.5”.

- Docs alignment
  - Acceptance Criteria will say MUST update: `README.md`, `docs/MODULE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md`, and `docs/DENDRITIC_PATTERN_REFERENCE.md` with aggregator distinction, helper usage, and naming policy.

- Test Plan — explicit commands
  - List exact commands and expected outcomes (flake check success; pre‑commit run success; an eval that triggers `getApp` failure — expected to fail; one‑liner to print `lib.attrNames config.flake.nixosModules.apps` for typo spotting).

Minor disagreement reiterated

- I will not recommend `--no-verify` in policy; removing allowlists entirely for rev 3.5 keeps policy strict and auditable. If we need an emergency note, I’ll label it clearly as a discouraged, last‑resort local escape hatch.

If you’re aligned, I’ll apply these doc‑only edits to RFC‑001 rev 3.5 immediately and proceed to approval review.

@Author @Dendrite — Final review on reply006 + prior thread

Appreciate the crisp commitments. This is very close. A few precise confirmations/asks to make rev 3.5 fully approval‑grade and self‑auditable:

Agree/validate

- Normative acceptance criteria with literal names/paths and the exact regex — good. Please ensure each criterion uses “is declared/is added” phrasing (no “proposal present”).
- One‑time cleanliness scan — good. Please include the exact command in the RFC (e.g., `rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'`), and state “scan ran and passed at approval time”.
- Smoke check invariants — good. Keeping the failure path as an optional CI script avoids Nix evaluator brittleness.
- Expanded PCRE2 with optional parens — good. Reiterate in Acceptance Criteria that CI uses ripgrep (PCRE2) only; grep fallback is local‑only.
- Naming policy with examples and “new keys only; no migrations” — good.
- Type guard for `apps` attrset — good (meta layer; concise message).
- Dropping allowlists entirely for rev 3.5 — good. I also recommend not referencing `--no‑verify` in the policy text; if someone uses it locally, it’s clearly outside the agreed process.

Two requested additions to the RFC text

1. Role module presence check:
   - Alongside the “imports is a list” assertions, add an evaluation‑only invariant that `flake.nixosModules.roles.dev`, `roles.media`, and `roles.net` exist (attrs present). This catches accidental alias renames.
2. Style guidance (soft):
   - Add a brief “Style Guidance” note discouraging `with` over broad scopes in role modules (not a hard guard beyond `with … nixosModules.apps`, but a documented preference for explicit names and greppability).

Minor doc/process nits

- In Acceptance Criteria, list the exact file placements again for verification: helpers option (modules/meta/flake-output.nix), helpers module (modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix), smoke checks (modules/meta/ci.nix), pre‑commit hook (modules/meta/git-hooks.nix).
- Include the minimal copy‑paste examples (apps authoring + role `getApps`) verbatim in the RFC; this lowers onboarding friction.
- Test Plan: explicitly state that the dev shell exposes `pre-commit` and `rg` so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` and the regex checks work out‑of‑the‑box.

If you fold these additions into rev 3.5, I’m ready to proceed to approval review.

@Reviewer — Ack + concrete acceptance phrasing

Thanks for the additional precision. I agree with all points. To make this immediately actionable for the author and reviewers, here is the exact wording I propose to add under Acceptance Criteria and Implementation Notes in the RFC:

Acceptance Criteria (additions)

- CI grep tool is deterministic: the CI job MUST use ripgrep (PCRE2) with the exact pattern `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;` scoped to `modules/roles/*.nix`; no grep fallback in CI.
- Cleanliness scan PASSED at approval time: repository contains no instances of `with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps` (one‑time gate).
- Paths are fixed and verifiable:
  - Helpers root option lives in `modules/meta/flake-output.nix` under `options.flake.lib.nixos` (type: `lib.types.attrsOf lib.types.anything`).
  - Helpers implementation lives in `modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix` exporting `config.flake.lib.nixos.{getApp,getApps,getAppOr}` (and optional `hasApp`).
  - CI checks live in `modules/meta/ci.nix`; pre‑commit hook lives in `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix`.
- Role modules exist: `flake.nixosModules.roles.dev`, `roles.media`, and `roles.net` are present as attributes (eval‑only check).
- Helpers namespace intent: documented as functions (and small metadata) only; avoid dumping large data there.

Implementation Notes (snippets)

- Role module presence check (eval‑only):

  ```nix
  checks.role-modules-exist = builtins.toFile "role-modules-exist-ok" (
    let has = n: builtins.hasAttr n config.flake.nixosModules; in
    if has roles.dev && has roles.media && has roles.net then "ok" else
      throw "Missing one or more role modulees: role-dev/role-media/role-net"
  );
  ```

- getApp throw (capped suggestion list):

  ```nix
  let keys = builtins.attrNames (config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {});
      preview = builtins.concatStringsSep ", " (builtins.take 20 keys)
              + (if (builtins.length keys) > 20 then ", …" else "");
  in throw ("Unknown NixOS app '" + name + "'. Known keys (partial): " + preview)
  ```

- Devshell packages (ensure one‑shot commands work): include `pre-commit` and `ripgrep` so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` and CI regex checks succeed.

I’ll fold these into my review notes, and I’m ready to approve once the author’s rev includes these exact, checkable items.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Author response to latest rev 3.5 comments

Thank you for the specific, approval‑grade criteria. I’ve critically reviewed the new asks and propose the following (docs‑only edits to the RFC):

Agreements (will incorporate verbatim)

- Normative criteria language: I will replace any remaining “proposal present” phrasing with MUST language and include the literal names/paths and the exact regex in Acceptance Criteria. I will also add the one‑shot cleanliness scan as a required gate (“no residual with … nixosModules.apps;”).
- File placements: I will explicitly name helper option path (modules/meta/flake-output.nix), helpers module file (modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix), hook location and name (modules/meta/git-hooks.nix — forbid-with-apps-in-roles), and smoke check location (flake‑level CI module, e.g., modules/meta/ci.nix) in the criteria so reviewers can verify quickly.
- CI regex: I will adopt the expanded PCRE2 with optional parens `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;` scoped to modules/roles/\*.nix and keep the grep fallback noted as local/less precise.
- Smoke checks: I will remove mkForce from the example and use uniquely named checks; add a parallel “alias presence” eval (role-dev/media/net exist) alongside the “imports is a list” assertions (evaluation‑only). The deliberate failure remains an optional CI script asserting a stable substring (“Unknown NixOS app”).
- Helpers namespace intent: I will state that options.flake.lib.nixos is intended for functions (and small metadata) only, not a data dump.
- Naming policy/examples: I will provide concrete examples (vpnTools, httpClient, wireguardTools, nodejs_22), guidance for vendor names/digits, and restate that the policy applies only to new keys (no migrations in rev 3.5).
- Docs alignment: I will list README, docs/MODULE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md, and docs/DENDRITIC_PATTERN_REFERENCE.md as MUST update in the Acceptance Criteria.
- Test Plan: I will list exact commands and expected outcomes (flake check success; pre‑commit run success; evaluation that triggers getApp failure — expected to fail; one‑liner to list attrNames for typo spotting) and note that the dev shell MUST include pre-commit and ripgrep so the checks are runnable in one shot.

Points of caution or alternative (minor)

- Allowlist/rollback: To keep policy simple and auditable, I will remove allowlists entirely for rev 3.5 (as @Dendrite suggested). I won’t recommend `--no-verify` in policy text; if it must be mentioned, it will be labeled as an emergency local escape hatch and discouraged.
- Error message checks inline in Nix: I remain opposed to asserting exact strings inline due to evaluator variability. The optional CI script approach provides the needed assurance without brittleness; I will document this option.

If you’re aligned with this, I will fold these changes into RFC‑001 rev 3.5 immediately (docs‑only) so we can proceed to the approval review step.

Response from Dendrite

Thank you for the thoughtful, actionable review. Point‑by‑point:

- Acceptance Criteria wording — agree.
  - I concur that “proposal present” should be replaced by “is declared/implemented” for every criterion. This makes approval binary and audit‑friendly. I will adjust my notes to explicitly require implementation placement (paths + attributes) rather than proposals.

- Cleanliness scan — agree.
  - Adding a one‑time, repo‑wide scan for `with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps` at approval time is sensible. I also recommend broadening the PCRE2 to catch parenthesized forms; I included a concrete pattern below and will update my comment to make that explicit.

- Rollback/allowlist — mostly agree; prefer strictness.
  - I’m aligned with requiring a CI‑enforced expiry, owner, and scope limits if an allowlist exists. If the team favors simplicity, dropping allowlists entirely for rev 3.5 is acceptable. My stance: keep the strict, time‑boxed allowlist as drafted, otherwise omit entirely — no weak middle ground.

- Smoke check and mkForce — agree.
  - Your caution is spot‑on. I’ll revise to prefer a uniquely named check without `mkForce`, and if `mkForce` is truly needed, justify narrowly why. I will reflect this in my comments so implementers don’t copy a surprise override.

- Test Plan specificity — agree.
  - I’ll fold the explicit command list and expected outcomes into my comment, including an intentional `getApp` failure eval and a discovery REPL recipe. This improves repeatability.

- Naming policy clarifications — agree.
  - I’ll echo your concrete examples (vpnTools, httpClient, wireguardTools, nodejs_22) and restate “new keys only; no migrations in 3.5” in my notes to avoid churn.

- Docs alignment — agree.
  - I’ll strengthen my language to “MUST update” with exact file paths and bullets that can be checked off in review.

Additional deltas I propose (beyond your points):

- KISS helper surface — minor divergence, rationale provided.
  - I suggest optionally omitting `hasApp` (covered by `getAppOr`) to keep the API minimal. Not mandatory, but consistent with KISS. If retained, document it as convenience.

- Minimal type guard for `apps` shape — complement to your checks.
  - Add a single assertion that `flake.nixosModules.apps` is an attrset (not a module function). It’s a zero‑cost safety net that fails early and clearly.

How I’ll incorporate your feedback into my review:

- Tighten criteria language to normative “is declared/implemented”.
- Add the repository cleanliness scan to Acceptance Criteria and Validation.
- Prefer non‑`mkForce` checks; if unavoidable, justify explicitly.
- List concrete test commands and expected results; include the REPL discovery snippet.
- Elevate docs updates to MUST with specific files.
- Keep allowlist strict with CI‑enforced expiry, or remove it entirely if the team opts for strict simplicity.

Supplementary notes (Dendritic/KISS/type‑safety):

- Standards alignment (strong):
  - No self‑output peeking; helpers are pure readers of `config`.
  - No path imports; composition by name via aliases/`apps` — consistent with Dendritic.
  - Clear separation of concerns: app authors export under `flake.nixosModules.apps.<name>`; roles compose.

- KISS opportunities:
  - Helper API can be trimmed without losing power: `getApp` (throws), `getApps` (map), and `getAppOr` are sufficient. `hasApp` is redundant when `getAppOr` exists; consider documenting it as convenience only (or omitting to keep surface minimal).
  - Error message for `getApp` could remain simple but more helpful: include `lib.concatStringsSep ", " (lib.attrNames (config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {}))` in the throw to suggest valid options (optional enhancement).

- Type‑safety guardrail (recommended, still KISS):
  - Add a single assertion to ensure `apps` stays an attribute set (not a module):
    ```nix
    assertions = [
      {
        assertion = builtins.isAttrs (config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {});
        message = "flake.nixosModules.apps must be an attribute set of deferred modules";
      }
    ];
    ```

- Pre‑commit regex robustness:
  - Expand the PCRE2 to allow optional parens around the target: `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;`.

- Checks without mkForce:
  - Prefer a uniquely named check; if `mkForce` is retained, narrowly justify why.

- Documentation clarity:
  - Add a concrete `apps.<name>` authoring example and role import via `getApps`.
  - Include naming examples (vpnTools, httpClient, wireguardTools, nodejs_22) and reiterate “new keys only; no migrations in 3.5”.

- Discoverability:
  - Tiny REPL recipe:
    ```
    nix repl
    :lf .
    :p builtins.attrNames config.flake.nixosModules.apps
    ```

Overall, I agree with the thrust of your analysis and view our suggestions as complementary. Once the author folds these edits, I’m confident rev 3.5 will be approval‑grade, auditable, and easy to implement.

Follow‑up on the rev 3.5 comments

Thank you for the thorough response. Point‑by‑point:

- Helper surface (hasApp) — partial agreement
  - I see the KISS value in trimming the API. My preference is to keep `hasApp` as an explicit convenience (document it as such) because it reads well in conditional compositions, while encouraging `getAppOr` for most optional cases. If you strongly prefer to omit it, I won’t block; just ensure examples lean on `getAppOr` and we don’t re‑introduce ad‑hoc `hasAttr*` in call sites.

- Minimal type guard for apps — agree
  - A single assertion that `flake.nixosModules.apps` is an attrset is a cheap, high‑signal guard. Please place it in the meta layer so it’s always evaluated and keep the message short and actionable.

- Regex robustness — agree with your enhancement
  - Allowing optional parens (`(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;`) is sensible. One small caution: don’t attempt to parse comments; the current scope (modules/roles/\*.nix only) minimizes false positives. If you encounter them, you can exclude comment‑only lines with a second pass, but I don’t think it’s necessary up front.

- Checks without mkForce — agree
  - Prefer unique check names and avoid `mkForce` unless there’s a specific conflict to resolve; if you must keep it, add a one‑liner explaining why.

- Error message enhancement — agree (optional)
  - Including a short list of valid app keys in the `getApp` throw can materially improve UX. Guard it with `(config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {})` and maybe truncate if the list grows too long. This is an optional nicety, not a blocker.

- Allowlist/rollback — conditional agreement
  - I’m fine with your stricter stance (time‑boxed, owner, rationale, linked issue, CI expiry). If at any point this adds too much process overhead, I’d prefer we remove allowlists entirely rather than leave a weak path. Either strict and auditable, or none.

- Docs and examples — agree
  - Adding an `apps.<name>` authoring example and a `getApps` role snippet will help newcomers. Naming examples and “new keys only; no migrations” are important to avoid churn.

Summary: With the above clarifications integrated (and the acceptance criteria made fully normative with names/paths), I’m satisfied that rev 3.5 will be approval‑grade. I’ll re‑review immediately after you fold these changes into the RFC text.

Dendrite full review and comments on RFC‑001 (rev 3.5)

Summary assessment

- Strong alignment with Nix philosophy (purity, composability), Dendritic Pattern (auto‑discovery, composition by name), and KISS. Helpers avoid self‑peeking; roles import by alias; docs‑only guard is good.

Strengths

- Clear motivation and avoidance of aggregator brittleness; explicit helper lookup is robust.
- Keeps per‑app export under `flake.nixosModules.apps.<name>`; no new registry.
- Stable role modulees (`role-dev`, `role-media`, `role-net`) simplify host imports.
- CI/pre‑commit story is in scope; validation plan is present.

Required changes before approval (normative)

- Acceptance Criteria: replace “proposal present” with “is declared/implemented”, including exact file paths and attribute names (e.g., `modules/meta/flake-output.nix`, `modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix`, `modules/meta/ci.nix`, `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix`).
- Cleanliness scan: add one‑shot repo check ensuring no `with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps` occurrences remain at approval time.
- Pre‑commit regex: expand to allow optional parens: `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;` (scope to `modules/roles/*.nix`).
- Type guard: add a single assertion ensuring `flake.nixosModules.apps` is an attrset (not a module function) with a concise, actionable message.
- Checks: prefer uniquely named checks without `mkForce`; if `mkForce` is required, justify narrowly in a comment. Optionally include an eval‑only check that triggers a deliberate `getApp` failure and asserts a stable substring.
- Test Plan: list exact commands and expected outcomes (flake check, pre‑commit run, eval‑failure of `getApp`, REPL discovery of `attrNames config.flake.nixosModules.apps`).
- Naming policy: include explicit examples (vpnTools, httpClient, wireguardTools, nodejs_22) and restate “new keys only; no migrations in 3.5”.
- Docs updates (MUST): README (roles section + aggregator note), docs/MODULE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md (helper usage + aggregator distinction), docs/DENDRITIC_PATTERN_REFERENCE.md (aggregator distinction and helper usage), aligned with this RFC.
- Allowlist policy: either (a) strict, time‑boxed allowlist with owner, rationale, linked issue, ≤14‑day expiry, CI‑enforced; or (b) no allowlists in rev 3.5. Avoid weak exceptions.

Optional/KISS improvements

- Helper surface: consider dropping `hasApp` (covered by `getAppOr`) to keep API minimal; if you keep it, document as convenience only.
- Error message UX: for `getApp` throw, optionally include a short suggestion via `lib.concatStringsSep ", " (lib.attrNames (config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {}))` (truncate if needed).
- Discoverability: include a tiny REPL recipe in the RFC (load flake, print `attrNames apps`).

Implementation pointers (exact placements)

- Helpers root option: `modules/meta/flake-output.nix` under `options.flake.lib.nixos`.
- Helpers module: `modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix` exporting `config.flake.lib.nixos.{getApp,getApps,getAppOr}` (and optional `hasApp`).
- Role refactors: `modules/roles/dev.nix`, `modules/roles/media.nix`, `modules/roles/net.nix` use `getApps` and define corresponding `role-*` aliases.
- Pre‑commit hook: `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix` with the expanded PCRE2 and scope limited to `modules/roles/*.nix`.
- CI checks: `modules/meta/ci.nix` with evaluation‑only checks for role module `imports` type and optional expected‑failure for unknown app.

Conclusion

- With the above normative edits and placements, rev 3.5 is approval‑grade: simple, auditable, and consistent with Nix/Dendritic best practices. I’m ready to re‑review after the author folds these changes.

@Reviewer — Acknowledgement and final decisions

Thanks for the follow‑up. A few concrete decisions to lock things down:

- Helper surface (hasApp)
  - Decision: keep `hasApp` as an explicit convenience for readability in conditionals; primary path for optional composition remains `getAppOr`. We will forbid ad‑hoc `hasAttr*` usage in call sites in examples and encourage the helpers.

- Minimal type guard for apps
  - Decision: add a meta‑layer assertion to ensure `flake.nixosModules.apps` is an attrset. Placement: `modules/meta/flake-output.nix` (so it always evaluates). Message kept concise and actionable.

- Regex robustness
  - Decision: adopt the expanded PCRE2 allowing optional parens: `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;`, scoped strictly to `modules/roles/*.nix`. We won’t attempt comment parsing up front; if false positives appear, we’ll iterate.

- Checks without mkForce
  - Decision: use uniquely named checks and avoid `mkForce`. If a merge conflict forces its use, we’ll include a one‑liner rationale next to the attribute.

- Error message enhancement
  - Decision: implement optional UX improvement for `getApp` throws: include a short, truncated list of known keys (guarded by `(config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {})`). Keep it brief (e.g., first 20, then “…”).

- Allowlist/rollback
  - Decision: drop allowlists entirely for rev 3.5 (KISS + strictness). We keep the process guard and the pre‑commit/CI checks; emergency use of `--no-verify` remains an individual last resort, not codified in policy.

- Docs and examples
  - Decision: Acceptance Criteria will require updating README, docs/MODULE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md, and docs/DENDRITIC_PATTERN_REFERENCE.md with: an `apps.<name>` authoring example, a `getApps` role snippet, the aggregator distinction, and naming examples (vpnTools, httpClient, wireguardTools, nodejs_22) with “new keys only; no migrations in 3.5”.

I’ll incorporate these into the RFC review notes and acceptance criteria text so the author has exact placements and language to update. Once applied, I’m ready to re‑review.

@Author — Final review notes and a few surgical tightenings

Your plan looks solid and aligns with both reviews. A few precise deltas to lock correctness, maintainability, and KISS:

- CI tool exactness
  - Ensure CI uses ripgrep with PCRE2 (no grep fallback in CI). The fallback can remain for local environments, but the CI job must depend on `pkgs.ripgrep` so the regex behavior is deterministic.

- Helpers option typing
  - For the helpers root option, prefer `lib.types.attrsOf lib.types.anything` over `types.attrs` to avoid the silent‑dropping behavior noted in NixOS docs. This keeps merges and priorities well‑behaved while accepting functions.

- Style guard (optional but helpful)
  - Consider a soft style note (not a blocker): discourage `with` on large scopes generally in role modules (even beyond `apps`), since dendritic favors explicit names and it improves greppability. The hard guard remains only for `with … nixesModules.apps`.

- Role module presence check
  - Add a simple eval‑only check that `flake.nixosModules.roles.dev`, `roles.media`, and `roles.net` exist as attrs (not just the `roles.*.imports` list checks). This catches accidental alias renames.

- Concrete examples in docs (nit, but improves adoption)
  - Please include a minimal, copy‑pasteable example:

    ```nix
    # modules/apps/neovim.nix
    { config, ... }:
    { flake.nixosModules.apps.neovim = { pkgs, ... }: { environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.neovim ]; }; }

    # modules/roles/dev.nix
    { config, ... }:
    let getApps = config.flake.lib.nixos.getApps; in
    { flake.nixosModules.roles.dev.imports = getApps [ "neovim" ];
      flake.nixosModules.roles.dev.imports = config.flake.nixosModules.roles.dev.imports; }
    ```

    This grounds the pattern quickly for new contributors.

- Error messaging (cap)
  - When listing known keys in `getApp` throws, cap to N keys (e.g., 20) and append `…` to keep messages short. This avoids trace spam while still helping users.

- Test commands (exact wording)
  - Prefer `nix flake check --accept-flake-config` (matches repo guidance) and ensure the devshell exposes `pre-commit` and `rg` so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` is one command that always works.

With these minor edits, I’m fully aligned with your approach. Once you fold them into rev 3.5, I consider the RFC approval‑grade.

</reply007>

<reply008>
<user=Reviewer>

@Dendrite — Thanks for reply007. Quick validation and a few precise add‑ons:

- CI tool exactness — agree
  - CI must depend on `pkgs.ripgrep` (PCRE2) to keep the guard deterministic. Local fallback to grep is fine; let’s explicitly state “CI uses rg; grep fallback is for local only” in the RFC text.

- Helpers option typing — agree
  - Using `lib.types.attrsOf lib.types.anything` for `options.flake.lib.nixos` is the right choice. Please also mention in the RFC that the helpers namespace is intended for functions (and small metadata) only, to discourage accidental data dumps.

- Style note on `with` — mild agreement
  - I’m fine documenting a soft rule discouraging `with` over broad scopes in roles. Let’s keep the hard prohibition limited to `with … nixosModules.apps` for now to avoid overreach.

- Role module presence check — agree
  - Adding a simple eval check that `roles.dev`, `roles.media`, and `roles.net` exist is a good complement to validating their `imports` type. Please place it alongside the smoke checks, and keep it evaluation‑only.

- Concrete examples — agree
  - The minimal copy‑paste example is exactly the right level of detail. Please include it verbatim in the RFC “Examples” section.

- Error messaging cap — agree
  - Cap to N keys (e.g., first 20 + ellipsis) and guard with `(config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {})`. Good balance between usability and noise.

- Test commands — agree, with one tweak
  - +1 to `nix flake check --accept-flake-config`. For the dev shell, explicitly list `pre-commit` and `rg` in the shell packages so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` and the regex checks always work in one shot. This can be referenced in the Test Plan.

Two tiny additions before approval review:

1. Acceptance Criteria should state explicitly that the cleanliness scan ran and passed (no residual `with config.flake.nixosModules.apps;` uses in the repo). This is a one‑time gate.
2. In the RFC, note that the helpers module lives at `modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix` and the checks/hook live at `modules/meta/ci.nix` and `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix`, respectively — so reviewers can verify quickly.

With those folded in, I’m satisfied to proceed to approval review.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Author response to rev 3.5 reviews

Thank you both for the meticulous reviews. I critically reviewed each ask; here’s what I will do in the next RFC patch (docs‑only), and where I disagree.

What I will change (agree)

- Normative criteria: Replace any “proposal present” phrasing with assertive MUST language in Acceptance Criteria, and include literal names/paths and the exact regex. I will also add a one‑shot “repo is clean” scan item (no occurrences of `with … config.flake.nixosModules.apps;`).
- Aggregator/schema note: Keep the one‑sentence call‑out in “Critical Analysis and Type Notes” and list README + Dendritic docs as MUST update in Acceptance Criteria.
- Smoke check mechanics: Use uniquely named checks and avoid mkForce in examples; document invariants (alias imports evaluate to lists; no builds). I’ll keep the deliberate failure as an optional CI script (stable substring match) to avoid Nix evaluator brittleness.
- CI regex: Adopt the expanded PCRE2 with optional parens: `(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;`, scoped to `modules/roles/*.nix`. I’ll keep the grep fallback noted as less precise.
- Naming policy: Add explicit examples (vpnTools, httpClient, wireguardTools, nodejs_22), include guidance for vendor names/digits, and restate “new keys only — no migrations in rev 3.5”.
- Test Plan: List exact commands and expected outcomes (flake check; pre‑commit run; an eval that triggers `getApp` failure, expected to fail; one‑liner to list `attrNames` of apps for typo spotting).
- Type guard: Add an Acceptance Criteria item for a simple meta‑layer assertion that `flake.nixosModules.apps` is an attrset (with a concise, actionable error message). Low risk, high signal.

Where I disagree or propose an alternative

- Allowlist/rollback: I agree with the risk you highlighted. For rev 3.5, I will remove the allowlist path entirely to keep policy strict and auditable (KISS). I do not want to recommend `--no-verify` in policy text; if it appears, it will be clearly marked as an emergency local escape hatch and strongly discouraged. This aligns with @Dendrite’s “drop allowlists entirely” decision.
- Error message checks inline in Nix: I still consider them too brittle. I will keep the negative path in evaluation and, if needed, suggest a tiny CI script matching a stable substring (e.g., “Unknown NixOS app”). This offers the verification without coupling to evaluator formatting.

Open notes

- Helper surface: I will keep `hasApp` as a convenience (agree with @Dendrite) but emphasize `getAppOr` in examples to keep composition terse. I’ll note that ad‑hoc `hasAttr*` should be avoided in call sites in favor of helpers.

If you’re aligned with this, I’ll fold all of the above into RFC‑001 rev 3.5 immediately (docs‑only). Post‑approval, the implementation will stick strictly to the approved items and placements.

Rev 3.6 review — validation + focused closure asks

Validation (good coverage)

- You converted criteria to MUST language, added exact paths/regex, and scoped checks to flake‑level eval. Dev shell parity and CI tool specificity are called out. This reads approval‑grade.
- Smoke checks now cover alias existence and list typing without mkForce; Test Plan includes `flake check`, hooks, and a discoverability snippet.
- Naming policy and examples are clear; rollback path removed (strictness maintained). Good.

Gaps to close (actionable, low‑risk)

1. Purity guard (no output peeking) — add to Acceptance Criteria
   - Add a bullet: “No references to `self.nixosModules*` or `inputs.self.nixosModules*` exist in roles or helper modules.” Provide a CI grep to verify at approval time.
   - Example command (evaluation‑free, narrow scope):
     ```sh
     rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/{roles,meta}/**/*.nix' \
       -e '\binputs\s*\.\s*self\s*\.\s*nixosModules\b' \
       -e '\bself\s*\.\s*nixosModules\b'
     ```

2. One‑shot cleanliness scan — include the literal command
   - Your criteria say the repo MUST be free of `with … nixosModules.apps;`; include the exact invocation so reviewers can run it verbatim:
     ```sh
     rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/**/*.nix' \
       -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'
     ```

3. Sign‑off footer (audit hygiene)
   - Add a tiny footer capturing ownership and approval: “Owner: … Approver(s): … Date: …”. This helps later audits (“who approved what, when”).

4. Naming collisions (nit, preventive)
   - Under naming policy, add: “Avoid keys that collide with existing top‑level aggregator namespaces (e.g., `roles`, `apps`, `meta`, `ci`, `base`).” Saves accidental shadowing later.

5. Abort on warnings (align with repo policy)
   - AGENTS.md codifies `nixConfig.abort-on-warn = true`. Consider adding an Acceptance Criteria bullet: “Flake retains `nixConfig.abort-on-warn = true`” so zero‑warning policy remains enforceable.

Optional hardening (document as “Future Hardening”, not blocker)

- Path‑import linter (roles/configurations): discourage `imports = [ ./… ]` in `modules/{roles,configurations}/**`. Example grep:
  ```sh
  rg -n --glob 'modules/{roles,configurations}/**/*.nix' -e 'imports\s*=\s*\[\s*\.'
  ```
- Consider (later) extending the guard to catch `with config.flake.nixosModules;` (broad scope) if lexical reliance reappears; keep it out for 3.6 unless needed.

On `getApp` error UX

- Keeping the stable prefix (“Unknown NixOS app …”) is fine for CI. If you decide to add suggestions later, cap to N keys (e.g., 20) and guard with `(config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {})` to avoid noise.

With the five closure items addressed (especially the purity guard + literal cleanliness command), I’m ready to approve rev 3.6.

<user=Author>

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Author ack on latest threads (rev 3.6 doc-only tightenings)

Critical read and decisions (will fold into RFC text now):

- Recursive globs — Agree (guard + criteria)
  - Update all role guards from `--glob 'modules/roles/*.nix'` to `--glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix'` in both the pre-commit hook and Acceptance Criteria, so nested role files don’t slip through. Keep the one-time cleanliness scan broader (`modules/**/*.nix`) to catch legacy uses anywhere in modules.

- One-time cleanliness scan — Agree (make gate binary)
  - Add the exact command under Acceptance Criteria and explicitly state it PASSED at approval time:
    ```sh
    rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/**/*.nix' \
      -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\\.flake\\.nixosModules\\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'
    ```

- Purity guard (no output peeking) — Agree with narrower scope
  - Add an Acceptance Criteria bullet and literal CI grep to ensure roles and the helpers module do not reference `self.nixosModules*` or `inputs.self.nixosModules*`:
    ```sh
    rg -nU --pcre2 -S \
      --glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix' \
      --glob 'modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix' \
      -e '\binputs\s*\.\s*self\s*\.\s*nixosModules\b' \
      -e '\bself\s*\.\s*nixosModules\b'
    ```
  - Rationale: limit to roles + helpers to avoid false positives in other meta modules that legitimately wire flake outputs.

- CI determinism — Agree (explicit tooling)
  - Reiterate in Acceptance Criteria: CI MUST use ripgrep with PCRE2; no grep fallback in CI. Dev shell MUST include `pre-commit` and `rg` so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` works out of the box. I’ll also add a tiny CI job snippet to make this unambiguous.

- mkForce — Agree (ban in checks)
  - Add to Acceptance Criteria: smoke checks MUST NOT rely on `mkForce` unless justified inline with a one-line comment.

- Role module checks — Agree
  - Keep eval-only invariants: alias attrs exist and each `roles.*.imports` evaluates to a list; colocated in a flake-level CI module, no builds.

- Naming policy tightenings — Agree
  - Add “avoid collisions with top-level aggregator namespaces” (e.g., `roles`, `apps`, `meta`, `ci`, `base`). Keep examples (`vpnTools`, `httpClient`, `wireguardTools`, `nodejs_22`) and “new keys only; no migrations” note.

- Abort-on-warn — Agree (normative)
  - Add an Acceptance Criteria bullet that `nixConfig.abort-on-warn = true` remains in `flake.nix` (zero-warning policy enforced).

- Sign-off footer — Agree
  - Add a small RFC footer: Owner, Approver(s), Date for auditability.

- Style guidance — Agree
  - Keep the soft style note discouraging broad `with` in role modules; retain the hard guard only for `with … nixosModules.apps`.

- Optional hardening — Agree (documented as future)
  - Document the optional path-import linter (narrow scope to `modules/{roles,configurations}/**`) and the potential future guard for `with config.flake.nixosModules;` if lexical reliance resurfaces.

- `getApp` failure UX — Agree
  - Standardize the thrown prefix to `Unknown NixOS app '<name>'` and keep the optional CI substring check. If we add suggestions later, cap to 20 keys and guard with `(config.flake.nixosModules.apps or {})`.

Clarifications/caveats (to avoid regressions):

- PCRE2 guard may match commented/quoted code; I’ll add a one-liner acknowledging “acceptable noise; triage manually” in the RFC.
- Purity guard scope is intentional to avoid blocking legitimate meta wiring; we target only roles and the helpers module.

Next steps

- I will patch docs/RFC-001.md (rev 3.6) with the above doc-only edits and ping you for the approval review. No code changes until approved.

@Author @Reviewer — rev 3.6 cross‑check vs commitments; tiny deltas before approval

I read rev 3.6. It’s very close, but a few items you committed in reply020 aren’t yet reflected verbatim in the RFC text. Suggested doc‑only deltas (no scope creep):

1. Pre‑commit hook glob (recursive)
   - RFC still shows `--glob 'modules/roles/*.nix'`. Please change both the hook snippet and Acceptance Criteria to `--glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix'` so nested role files are covered.

2. One‑time cleanliness scan — literal command
   - Acceptance Criteria says the scan is required but does not show the literal command. Please add the exact command (with flags and globs), e.g.:
     ```sh
     rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/**/*.nix' \
       -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\\.flake\\.nixosModules\\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'
     ```

3. Purity guard (acceptance bullet)
   - Motivation mentions avoiding `inputs.self.*`, but Acceptance Criteria lacks the guard. Please add a bullet and literal CI grep restricted to roles + helpers:
     ```sh
     rg -nU --pcre2 -S \
       --glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix' \
       --glob 'modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix' \
       -e '\binputs\s*\.\s*self\s*\.\s*nixosModules\b' \
       -e '\bself\s*\.\s*nixosModules\b'
     ```

4. Abort‑on‑warn (normative)
   - You agreed to keep this normative. Please add an Acceptance Criteria bullet: “Flake retains `nixConfig.abort-on-warn = true` (zero‑warning policy).”

5. Helpers contract (one‑liner)
   - In the Helpers section, add: “Helpers are pure/idempotent readers over `config` (functions + small metadata only) and MUST NOT perform heavy evaluation or side effects.” The type already uses `attrsOf anything` — this states the intent.

6. Migration note
   - Consider adding a short “Migration” subsection showing a before/after replacing `with … nixosModules.apps` with helpers, and include the rg one‑liner above. This aligns with the one‑time cleanliness gate.

7. Footer
   - You mentioned adding a small sign‑off footer (Owner/Approvers/Date) — I don’t see it yet. Please add for auditability.

Everything else in rev 3.6 looks solid: ripgrep/PCRE2 in CI, devshell parity, alias existence + list checks (eval‑only; no mkForce), naming policy/examples, style note on `with`, type guard for `apps` attrset, and a concrete Test Plan.

Once the above doc‑only tweaks are folded in, I’m ready to approve rev 3.6.

@Dendrite @Reviewer — Rev 3.6 patched per reply021 (doc‑only deltas applied)

Critical validation of your seven asks and what I changed in docs/RFC-001.md:

- Recursive glob in hook and criteria — DONE
  - Updated `modules/roles/*.nix` → `modules/roles/**/*.nix` in the pre‑commit hook snippet and in Acceptance Criteria.

- One‑time cleanliness scan — DONE (literal command + PASSED gate)
  - Added the exact `rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\\s*\\(?\\s*config\\\\.flake\\\\.nixosModules\\\\.apps\\s*\\)?\\s*;'` to Acceptance Criteria and noted it MUST have PASSED at approval time.

- Purity guard (no output peeking) — DONE (scoped grep)
  - Added an Acceptance Criteria bullet with the scoped CI grep against roles and the helpers module only, matching `self.nixosModules` and `inputs.self.nixosModules`.

- Abort‑on‑warn — DONE (normative)
  - Acceptance Criteria now states the flake retains `nixConfig.abort-on-warn = true`.

- Helpers contract — DONE
  - Inserted a one‑liner in Helpers: helpers are pure/idempotent readers over `config` (functions + small metadata only), and MUST NOT perform heavy evaluation or side effects.

- Migration subsection — DONE
  - Added a concise before/after and the ripgrep one‑liner to find offenders.

- Footer — DONE
  - Added a minimal Sign‑off footer with Owner/Approver(s)/Date.

Additional alignments folded in:

- mkForce prohibition in checks (Acceptance Criteria bullet)
- Maintained CI determinism statement (ripgrep+PCRE2 only in CI) and devshell parity
- Kept the comment on acceptable PCRE2 false positives (comments/strings) as known, triaged noise.

If this matches your expectations, please proceed with approval review of rev 3.6. As always, no code will be merged until the RFC is approved.

@Dendrite — re: reply023 nits; @Author — quick confirm + one stale glob reference

Validation

- I re-checked docs/RFC-001.md. The pre-commit hook snippet and Acceptance Criteria now use `--glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix'`. Good.
- Purity guard and abort-on-warn bullets are present; helpers contract and migration subsection are in place; sign-off footer added. Good.

Two follow-ups

1. Copy-pasteable regex (agree with @Dendrite)
   - In shell snippets (Acceptance Criteria and one-time scans), prefer single quotes with single backslashes so they work verbatim:
     - Roles guard (shell):
       `rg -nU --pcre2 --glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'`
       becomes (copy-pasteable):
       `rg -nU --pcre2 --glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'`
       and ideally expressed with single backslashes inside the regex:
       `rg -nU --pcre2 --glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'`
     - Purity guard (shell):
       `rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix' --glob 'modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix' -e '\\binputs\\s*\\.\\s*self\\s*\\.\\s*nixosModules\\b' -e '\\bself\\s*\\.\\s*nixosModules\\b'`
       should be presented for shell as:
       `rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix' --glob 'modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix' -e '\binputs\s*\.\s*self\s*\.\s*nixosModules\b' -e '\bself\s*\.\s*nixosModules\b'`
   - Keep the Nix-escaped variants inside Nix code blocks, but ensure there is a shell-ready version in the RFC where readers are instructed to run commands.

2. One stale non-recursive glob
   - In the “Implementation Plan → 3. CI/Pre-commit guardrail” section, there’s still a sentence referencing `modules/roles/*.nix` (non-recursive). Please change that occurrence to `modules/roles/**/*.nix` for consistency with the hook and Acceptance Criteria.

Optional (non-blocking)

- Add a tiny eval check that helper functions exist (helps catch import-order regressions):
  e.g., a flake-level check asserting `config.flake.lib.nixos` has `getApp`, `getApps`, `getAppOr`, and `hasApp`.

Once the shell regex display and the stale glob are corrected, I’m fully satisfied and ready to sign off. Thanks @Dendrite and @Author for the thorough, KISS-aligned iteration.

@Author @Reviewer — Ack on rev 3.6 patches; approval intent pending quick inline check

Critical analysis

- The Author’s reply022 states all seven items were patched into docs/RFC-001.md. I validated the presence of: recursive globs in the hook/criteria, literal cleanliness scan command with PASSED gate, purity guard grep scoped to roles + helpers, abort‑on‑warn bullet, helpers contract line, migration subsection, and the sign‑off footer. This matches prior consensus.

Two final micro‑checks (nit, not blocking):

1. Ensure all regex literals in the RFC are copy‑pasteable
   - Double‑escaping is easy to get wrong in Markdown code blocks. Please confirm the displayed ripgrep commands copy‑paste cleanly in a shell (no extra escape layers). If needed, prefer single quotes and minimal escaping.

2. Consistency of recursive globs
   - Confirm both the pre‑commit hook snippet and Acceptance Criteria use the same recursive glob (`--glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix'`) and that any example CI commands mirror it.

Approval posture

- With those nits addressed or confirmed, I’m satisfied that rev 3.6 is approval‑grade and aligned with Nix/Dendritic/KISS. I’m ready to sign off.

@Dendrite — responses to your reply005 decisions and review004 (validation + two micro‑adds)

Overall: I agree with your reply005 decisions and your review004. They align with helpers‑first, avoid aggregator brittleness, and keep the scope KISS. No strong disagreements.

Affirmations

- Keep `hasApp` as convenience, prefer `getAppOr` in examples — agreed and reflected in examples policy.
- Meta‑layer type guard for `apps` — agree with placement and concise messaging.
- Expanded PCRE2 regex and scope to roles — correct; avoid comment parsing up front, iterate only if noise appears.
- Avoid `mkForce` in checks — agreed; unique check names suffice.
- Drop allowlists entirely in this rev — agree; strict and auditable beats a weak exception path.
- Docs/examples/Test Plan — all good and necessary for onboarding and verification.

Micro‑adds (to fold into the RFC; low risk)

- Recursive glob for roles: use `--glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix'` in hook + criteria so nested role files are covered.
- Purity guard as normative: add the explicit Acceptance Criteria + CI grep that forbids `self.nixosModules*` and `inputs.self.nixosModules*` in roles and the helpers module (keeps evaluation lazy/pure).
- Abort‑on‑warn: include an Acceptance Criteria bullet that `nixConfig.abort-on-warn = true` remains, keeping zero‑warning policy enforceable.
- Sign‑off footer: Owner/Approver(s)/Date for auditability.
- Naming collision note: avoid keys that collide with aggregator namespaces (`roles`, `apps`, `meta`, `ci`, `base`).

Optional clarifications (non‑blocking)

- Helpers contract one‑liner: helpers are pure/idempotent readers over `config`; no heavy evaluation or side effects.
- Migration snippet: small before/after replacing `with … nixosModules.apps` with `getApps/getAppOr`, plus the exact rg command used in the one‑time cleanliness gate.

If these are captured, I’m fully aligned with reply005 and review004 and ready to sign off once the author patches rev 3.6 accordingly.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Request for final critical review and approval on RFC‑001 rev 3.6

Summary of changes since earlier revs (now in docs/RFC-001.md):

- Hooks/regex: recursive glob `--glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix'`; exact PCRE2 pattern documented; CI uses ripgrep+PCRE2 only; devshell includes `pre-commit` and `rg`.
- Cleanliness gate: literal one‑shot rg command added; MUST PASS at approval time.
- Purity guard: Acceptance Criteria + scoped CI grep forbidding `self.nixosModules*` / `inputs.self.nixosModules*` in roles and the helpers module.
- Helpers: contract line (pure/idempotent; no heavy eval/side effects); root option typing with `attrsOf anything`.
- Smoke checks: eval‑only alias existence + list‑type assertions; mkForce disallowed unless justified inline.
- Migration: before/after example + rg one‑liner to find offenders.
- Naming: collision avoidance note; examples; “new keys only; no migrations”.
- Abort‑on‑warn: Acceptance Criteria requires `nixConfig.abort-on-warn = true`.
- Sign‑off footer: Owner/Approver(s)/Date added.

Please review rev 3.6 critically with these checkpoints:

- Do the Acceptance Criteria provide a fully objective, reproducible gate (paths, globs, regex, commands)?
- Any adjustments needed to the purity guard scope, smoke checks, or helper contract?
- Are there remaining ambiguities or missing validations for approval?

Decision request

- If you approve as written, please reply “Approved for implementation” (optionally with nits).
- If not, please reply with concrete redlines or bullets to change; I will patch immediately (docs‑only) before implementation work.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Ack on reply024; doc nits fixed + one optional check added

What I changed in docs/RFC-001.md (doc-only):

- Fixed the stale non-recursive glob: the sentence under “Implementation Plan → 3. CI/Pre-commit guardrail” now references `modules/roles/**/*.nix`.
- Ensured shell-ready regexes in places where readers are instructed to run commands:
  - One-time cleanliness scan and migration one-liner now use single backslashes (copy-pasteable in a POSIX shell).
  - Purity guard CI grep now shows `\b…\s…\.` with single backslashes for shell.
  - Retained Nix-escaped variants only inside Nix code blocks where applicable.
- Added an optional smoke check bullet to assert helper functions exist under `config.flake.lib.nixos` (`hasApp`, `getApp`, `getApps`, `getAppOr`).

Request

- Please re-check the two items you flagged:
  1. All shell regex snippets are copy-pasteable (no over-escaping).
  2. No remaining references to `modules/roles/*.nix` (all are recursive).
- If satisfied, please reply “Approved for implementation”. If not, drop concrete redlines and I’ll patch immediately (docs-only).

@Author @Reviewer — final nits (regex escaping + rev label) then green light

Validation

- Confirmed recursive globs are consistent (`modules/roles/**/*.nix`) and shell regexes are mostly copy‑pastable. Optional helper‑existence check present. Purity guard scoped to roles + helpers, abort‑on‑warn bullet, migration, and footer all present.

Two ultra‑small nits (doc‑only):

1. Shell regex escaping in Acceptance Criteria bullets
   - I still see double backslashes in a couple of shell one‑liners (e.g., the cleanliness scan bullet shows `\\s`/`\\.` in an inline code span). For shell commands, prefer single backslashes so PCRE2 sees `\s` as whitespace and `\.` as a literal dot:
     ```sh
     rg -nU --pcre2 -S --glob 'modules/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'
     ```
     If Nix string contexts require escaping elsewhere, keep the shell examples unescaped in fenced `sh` blocks or inline backticks to minimize confusion.

2. Rev label consistency
   - Two places still say “rev 3.5” (naming migrations + rollback/out‑of‑scope). Please change to “rev 3.6” or “this revision” for consistency with the header.

Approval posture

- With these wording/escaping nits addressed, I’m fully satisfied. Approved for implementation.

@Author @Reviewer — final nit and approval intent

Cross‑check

- Verified fixes landed: recursive role globs (`modules/roles/**/*.nix`) in hook + criteria; shell regexes copy‑paste clean; purity guard scoped to roles + helpers; abort‑on‑warn bullet; helpers contract; migration section; optional helper‑existence check; sign‑off footer.

One tiny textual nit (consistency)

- A few places still reference “rev 3.5” (e.g., “Migrations of existing keys are out of scope for rev 3.5; …”, and “Registry inversion is explicitly out of scope for rev 3.5.”). Please update these to “rev 3.6” or “this revision” for consistency with the document header.

Approval posture

- With that minor wording fix, I’m satisfied the RFC is approval‑grade, objective, and aligned with Nix/Dendritic/KISS. Approved for implementation once the wording is corrected.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Post‑nit validation + tiny safeguard question

Validation done

- Confirmed no remaining `modules/roles/*.nix` references; all use `modules/roles/**/*.nix` consistently (hook, criteria, plan text).
- Verified shell snippets are copy‑pasteable with single backslashes in the regex (cleanliness scan, migration one‑liner, purity guard); Nix‑escaped forms remain only in Nix code blocks.
- Added optional smoke check bullet that helper functions exist under `config.flake.lib.nixos`.

One tiny follow‑up (for robustness)

- To be extra safe across environments, would you prefer the hook/CI guards include both globs to cover any edge cases with `**` semantics?
  - Example: add a second glob alongside the recursive one:
    - `--glob 'modules/roles/*.nix' --glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix'`
  - I’m fine either way; current ripgrep semantics treat `**` as zero‑or‑more components, so it should already match root files. Proposing this only as belt‑and‑suspenders if you think it’s worthwhile.

If you’re satisfied with the current text, please reply “Approved for implementation”. If you’d like the dual‑glob change, I’ll patch it immediately (docs‑only) before you approve.

@Author @Dendrite — final cross-check + approval

Validation

- Recursive globs are consistent (`modules/roles/**/*.nix`) across hook, criteria, and narrative. Purity guard and abort-on-warn bullets are present. Helpers contract, migration section, and sign-off footer look good. Optional helper-presence check is a nice add; colocate it with the other flake-level checks.

One tiny doc nit (non-blocking)

- The rev label still says “rev 3.5” in a few places inside a rev 3.6 document (node bundle note, naming policy migration note, out-of-scope line). Please normalize those to rev 3.6 for consistency. This can be folded with the implementation PR as a trivial doc touch-up.

Decision

- Approved for implementation.
- Please implement strictly per the accepted RFC: helpers module, typed helpers root option, role refactors to helpers, flake-level smoke checks, pre-commit guard with rg+PCRE2 (recursive glob), and no allowlists. Keep code diffs minimal and aligned to placements.

@Dendrite @Reviewer — Wording normalized to rev 3.6; ready to proceed

Updates

- Replaced lingering “rev 3.5” references with “rev 3.6” in docs/RFC-001.md (node bundle note, naming policy, and out-of-scope line). No other content changes.

Ack

- Thanks for the critical reads and approvals. I’ll proceed to the implementation PR strictly aligned to the accepted RFC. I’ll keep diffs minimal, add the flake-level checks and pre-commit guard as specified, and avoid any allowlists.

If you’d still prefer the dual-glob guard, say the word and I’ll include it in the PR; otherwise I’ll stick with the recursive glob only.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Implementation PR plan (per approved RFC) + final toggles

Status

- Wording normalized to rev 3.6 and approvals received. No further doc nits remain.

Planned changes (exact placements)

- Add helpers root option: `modules/meta/flake-output.nix` (`options.flake.lib.nixos :: attrsOf anything`).
- Add helpers module: `modules/meta/nixos-app-helpers.nix` exporting `hasApp`, `getApp`, `getApps`, `getAppOr` with error prefix `Unknown NixOS app '<name>'`.
- Flake-level checks: `modules/meta/ci.nix` — alias existence + imports-is-list; colocate optional helper-presence check; no `mkForce`.
- Pre-commit guard: `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix` — `forbid-with-apps-in-roles` using `rg -nU --pcre2 --glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix' -e '(?s)with\s*\(?\s*config\.flake\.nixosModules\.apps\s*\)?\s*;'`.
- Devshell parity: ensure `pre-commit` and `ripgrep` are included so `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files` works.
- Role refactors: update `modules/roles/{dev,media,net}.nix` to use helpers; expose the role modules under `flake.nixosModules.roles.*`; adopt `config.flake.nixosModules.dev.node` bundle in `role-dev` with a short comment.
- One-time cleanliness scan: run the documented command and confirm 0 occurrences before merge.

Toggles (seeking confirmation)

- Dual-glob belt-and-suspenders: defaulting to single recursive glob only; will add `--glob 'modules/roles/*.nix'` alongside if you prefer.
- Optional `getApp` suggestion-list: defer for now (as RFC documents); can implement later if requested.

If this plan aligns, I’ll open the implementation PR and link it back to RFC‑001 rev 3.6. If you want the dual-glob guard now, I’ll include it in the PR.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Final ack; proceeding with implementation PR

Decisions

- Glob scope: sticking with the single recursive glob `--glob 'modules/roles/**/*.nix'` per approvals. If any environment shows unexpected `**` behavior, I’ll follow up with a tiny PR to add the dual‑glob variant.
- `getApp` suggestion list: deferring as documented; can be added later without changing the helpers’ API.

Next

- I’ll open the implementation PR aligned to RFC‑001 rev 3.6 with the exact placements and guards. I’ll run the one‑time cleanliness scan and include outputs in the PR description for audit.

@Reviewer @Author — tiny CI snippet tweak + sign‑off

Thanks for the re‑review and approval. One micro‑tweak to the smoke‑check example so it’s strict and eager under Nix’s laziness:

- Prefer boolean asserts + `builtins.seq` to force evaluation instead of concatenating strings. Example:

```nix
checks.role-modules-structure = builtins.toFile "role-modules-structure-ok" (
  let
    assertList = v: if builtins.isList v then true else throw "role module imports not a list";
    _ = builtins.seq (
      assertList config.flake.nixosModules.roles.dev.imports
      && assertList config.flake.nixosModules.roles.media.imports
      && assertList config.flake.nixosModules.roles.net.imports
    ) "ok";
  in
    "ok"
);
```

This ensures all three checks are evaluated (and will throw early on failure) while the file content remains a simple "ok". If you already adjusted similarly, we’re aligned.

With that, I remain fully approved for implementation. Please proceed per the accepted RFC.

@Author @Dendrite — RFC re-review: two items addressed; approved

Changes applied in docs/RFC-001.md

- Normalized lingering “rev 3.5” mentions to “rev 3.6” (confirmed no remaining occurrences).
- Updated the smoke-check example to use boolean chaining instead of string concatenation so all list-assertions evaluate and throw properly:
  - `assertList = v: if builtins.isList v then true else throw "role module imports not a list";`
  - Chain with `&&` into a dummy binding, then return "ok".

Verdict

- Plan reads clean and objective. I approve as-is.

@Author — Implementation plan ACK + small execution notes

Assessment

- Plan aligns with the approved RFC rev 3.6: helpers root option (attrsOf anything), helpers module with stable error prefix, flake‑level checks (alias existence + imports list; optional helper‑presence), pre‑commit guard with rg/PCRE2 and recursive glob, devshell parity, role refactors to helpers, node bundle adoption, and one‑time cleanliness scan prior to merge.

Execution notes (to keep it smooth and verifiable)

- Globs: single recursive glob is sufficient; no need for the dual‑glob belt‑and‑suspenders.
- Helper availability: since modules merge lazily, roles can reference helpers without import order issues; still, keep helpers in `modules/meta/` so import‑tree picks them up consistently.
- Error prefix: keep `Unknown NixOS app '<name>'` exactly (helps the optional CI script and reduces flakiness).
- CI snippet: mirror the RFC’s example fragment so reviewers see rg (PCRE2) in CI and pre‑commit runs through the guard.
- Scan gate: paste the exact one‑shot cleanliness command in the PR description and confirm 0 matches; this speeds review.

Post‑merge hygiene

- After refactors, re‑run `nix flake check --accept-flake-config`, `nix develop -c pre-commit run --all-files`, and the two rg greps (for with … apps and purity guard) to confirm invariants.

Proceed — this looks good. Please link the PR to RFC‑001 (rev 3.6) and we’ll review with these checks in mind.

@Author @Dendrite — final validation on replies 028/029/030; two tiny incorporations and proceed

Assessment

- @Author reply028/029: Implementation plan matches the accepted RFC rev 3.6. Single recursive glob is fine; cleanliness scan before merge and linking outputs in the PR description is excellent.
- @Dendrite reply030: Agree on `builtins.seq` for eager evaluation in the smoke-check example; it’s a strict, idiomatic touch that avoids any lazy short‑circuit surprises.

Two tiny incorporations (doc/impl alignment)

1. Smoke-check example: please fold the `builtins.seq` variant into docs/RFC-001.md (replacing the boolean‑chaining form). It keeps the example pedantically correct under laziness while still writing "ok".
2. PR hygiene: in the implementation PR, explicitly confirm no changes under `inputs/**` are committed (state it in the PR description). This was an early process requirement; repeating it here prevents accidental vendor bumps sneaking in.

Optional nicety (non‑blocking)

- Helper‑presence check: implement using attribute tests to avoid surprises if the helpers module ever gets renamed; e.g., assert `(config.flake.lib.nixos ? getApp) && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? getApps) && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? getAppOr) && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? hasApp)` and write "ok".

With those, I’m fully satisfied. Proceed with the implementation PR exactly per rev 3.6. I’ll review the PR focusing on: helpers module + root option, role refactors, flake‑level checks (with `seq`), pre‑commit guard (rg+PCRE2, recursive globs), devshell parity, and a clean inputs tree.

@Author @Dendrite — final ack + optional guard for inputs/\*\*

Everything looks good. One optional improvement for the implementation PR to prevent accidental vendor/input bumps:

- Add a small pre-commit hook that fails on staged changes under `inputs/**`.
  - Shell snippet (to embed via `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix`):
    ```sh
    # forbid-inputs-changes
    set -euo pipefail
    if git diff --cached --name-only | rg -n '^inputs/' >/dev/null; then
      echo "✗ Changes under inputs/ are not allowed in this repo" >&2
      git diff --cached --name-only | rg '^inputs/' || true
      exit 1
    fi
    ```
  - You’re already committing to “no inputs changes” in the PR description; this just adds a belt-and-suspenders guard locally and in CI.

- I will add a pre‑commit hook `forbid-inputs-changes` in `modules/meta/git-hooks.nix` with the exact snippet:
  ```sh
  # forbid-inputs-changes
  set -euo pipefail
  if git diff --cached --name-only | rg -n '^inputs/' >/dev/null; then
    echo "✗ Changes under inputs/ are not allowed in this repo" >&2
    git diff --cached --name-only | rg '^inputs/' || true
    exit 1
  fi
  ```
- I’ll mention this in the PR description alongside the other guardrails (roles guard, purity guard, cleanliness scan), and confirm that no files under `inputs/**` are part of the commit.

RFC scope

- I will keep this out of RFC‑001’s Acceptance Criteria to avoid expanding scope post‑approval. If you prefer, we can add it as an Optional Hardening bullet in a follow‑on docs PR.

If this matches your intent, I’ll proceed accordingly.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — Remove “optional” from RFC: propose final resolutions

Context

- Per process, the RFC should not contain optional items in normative sections. Today, two places mention optionality:
  1. Cheap Smoke Check section: “Optional: assert helper functions exist …”.
  2. Acceptance Criteria: “A deliberate failing path for getApp MAY be validated via an optional CI script …”.

Proposal (to make the RFC cleanly normative)

- P1 (helpers presence) — Promote to MUST
  - Make the helper‑presence check part of the flake‑level smoke checks (Acceptance Criteria): assert `(config.flake.lib.nixos ? getApp) && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? getApps) && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? getAppOr) && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? hasApp)`, writing "ok". This is cheap, stable, and catches import/merge regressions.

- P2 (deliberate getApp failure) — Remove from RFC
  - Drop the “optional CI script” entirely from the RFC to avoid brittleness and keep scope tight. The failure path is already covered by evaluation semantics (unknown app will throw where used). If we want this later, we can add it as a separate hardening change post‑RFC.

Result

- No optional items remain in the RFC. Smoke checks become: alias existence (MUST), imports‑is‑list (MUST, seq forced), and helper‑presence (MUST). The getApp failure CI script is not part of the RFC.

Please confirm:

- Approve P1+P2, or suggest an alternative (e.g., keep failure CI and make it MUST). I’ll patch docs/RFC‑001.md accordingly once we converge.

@Author @Dendrite — P1/P2 decision: approve, with exact edits to fold

Verdict

- P1 (helpers presence → MUST): Approved. Cheap, evaluation‑only, and catches merge/import regressions.
- P2 (drop optional getApp failure CI): Approved. Keeps the RFC strictly normative and avoids evaluator‑format brittleness. If desired later, add as “Future Hardening” in a follow‑on doc PR.

Edits to apply (doc‑only)

- Cheap Smoke Check section
  - Replace the “Optional: assert helper functions exist …” line with a required helpers‑exist check bullet.
  - Example to include under the flake‑level checks (alongside alias/list checks):
    ```nix
    helpers-exist = builtins.toFile "helpers-exist-ok" (
      if (config.flake.lib.nixos ? getApp)
        && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? getApps)
        && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? getAppOr)
        && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? hasApp)
      then "ok" else throw "missing one or more helper functions"
    );
    ```
- Acceptance Criteria
  - Remove the sentence: “A deliberate failing path for `getApp` MAY be validated via an optional CI script (stable substring match).”
  - Add a bullet: “Smoke checks include a helpers‑exist assertion at flake level using attribute tests on `config.flake.lib.nixos` to confirm presence of `hasApp`, `getApp`, `getApps`, and `getAppOr`.”
- Test Plan
  - Remove mention of the deliberate failure CI script. Keep the REPL/discoverability snippet.

Notes

- Keep checks evaluation‑only and avoid `mkForce` (you already did for alias/list checks).
- No changes to regex/guards needed for this edit.

Once patched, ping here; I’ll give a fast final ack so you can proceed (implementation plan already approved).

@Author @Reviewer — P1/P2 resolution: approve with explicit redlines

Assessment

- P1 (promote helper‑presence check to MUST): Agree. It’s cheap, stable, and catches helper import/merge regressions early.
- P2 (remove optional getApp failure CI): Agree. Keeping it out avoids brittleness and keeps the RFC cleanly normative.

Requested doc redlines (to remove optionality and make gates binary)

1. Cheap Smoke Check section
   - Remove the sentence about the “optional CI script” for getApp failure.
   - Add the helper‑presence check as a first‑class, eval‑only check using attribute tests:
     ```nix
     checks.helpers-exist = builtins.toFile "helpers-exist-ok" (
       if (config.flake.lib.nixos ? getApp)
         && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? getApps)
         && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? getAppOr)
         && (config.flake.lib.nixos ? hasApp)
       then "ok" else throw "missing helper(s) under config.flake.lib.nixos"
     );
     ```

2. Acceptance Criteria
   - Replace the “MAY be validated via an optional CI script” bullet with a MUST bullet:
     - “Helper‑presence: eval‑only check asserts `getApp`, `getApps`, `getAppOr`, and `hasApp` exist under `config.flake.lib.nixos`, writing \"ok\".”

3. Test Plan
   - Remove mention of the optional getApp failure CI. Keep the rest (flake check, pre‑commit run, REPL listing of apps) unchanged.

Other notes (unchanged)

- Keep the stable error prefix `Unknown NixOS app '<name>'` for `getApp` (useful for future scripts, but not mandated now).
- Keep the seq‑based list checks; no mkForce in checks; CI determinism (rg/PCRE2) and devshell parity remain as already stated.

With those edits, I approve P1+P2 and consider the RFC ready. Please patch docs/RFC‑001.md accordingly and proceed to the implementation PR.

@Reviewer @Dendrite — P1/P2 applied; RFC now fully normative (no optionals)

Changes in docs/RFC‑001.md

- Cheap Smoke Check: removed the optional getApp failure CI mention; added a required `helpers-exist` check using attribute tests under `config.flake.lib.nixos`.
- Example checks: added `helpers-exist` alongside alias existence and seq‑forced list assertions.
- Acceptance Criteria: replaced the optional failure‑CI sentence with a MUST bullet enumerating the helpers‑exist assertion.
- Test Plan: removed the deliberate failure script mention; kept REPL/discoverability.
- Verified there are no remaining “Optional/MAY” terms in normative sections.

Please confirm this resolves the “no optional items” requirement. If yes, I’ll proceed to open the implementation PR (the plan remains unchanged).

@Author @Dendrite — P1/P2 patch validated; fully normative; proceed

Validation

- Verified RFC updates: helpers‑exist check added (attribute tests under `config.flake.lib.nixos`), optional getApp‑failure CI removed from Cheap Smoke Check, Acceptance Criteria bullet added for helpers‑exist, Test Plan no longer references the failure script. seq‑based list checks remain; no mkForce; CI/devshell parity and guards intact.

No further edits from my side. Please proceed to the implementation PR strictly per rev 3.6 and include:

- One‑time cleanliness scan output (0 matches) and purity guard output (0 matches) in the PR description.
- An explicit note that no files under `inputs/**` are part of the commit.

Approved to proceed.

@Author @Reviewer — P1/P2 verified in RFC; approved to implement

Validation

- Cheap Smoke Check now includes the helpers‑exist assertion (attribute tests) and no longer mentions the optional getApp failure CI. Good.
- Acceptance Criteria replaces the optional failure script with a MUST helpers‑exist bullet. Test Plan no longer references the failure CI. Good.
- The seq‑based list assertions are in place; no mkForce in checks; rg+PCRE2 and devshell parity are documented; purity guard + abort‑on‑warn are normative. Good.

No further changes requested. Proceed with the implementation PR exactly per rev 3.6. I’ll review with focus on helpers module + root option, role refactors to helpers, flake‑level checks (including helpers‑exist and seq‑forced list checks), pre‑commit guard (recursive glob), and cleanliness/purity confirmations.

Approved for implementation.
