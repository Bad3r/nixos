# Additional Tools: Runtime Smoke-Test Status

Companion report for `docs/csec/additional-tools-reference.md`. Each tool's
documented `run` command was invoked with a help or version flag (placeholders
such as `$target`, `$url`, `$domain` substituted) under a 60-second timeout to
confirm the package can launch on the current `flake.lock` state.

Verified on 2026-05-04 against the active flake pin.

The reference doc flags each unavailable tool inline (the entry's `run..:`
field carries text such as `Not in nixpkgs ...` or `Must create a custom nixpkg`); there is no dedicated section for them. The groupings below are
this report's, collected by the underlying reason for the failure.

## ⚠️ Failures grouped by issue

### Documented as not in nixpkgs

The reference itself flags these. Listed for completeness.

- ⚠️ crackmapexec (project archived; reference instructs using `netexec`)
- ⚠️ gf (nixpkgs `gf` is an unrelated GDB frontend)
- ⚠️ anew (closest match `anewer` is unrelated)
- ⚠️ wifite (Python 2 EOL; reference instructs using `wifite2`)
- ⚠️ reaver

### Documented as needing a local custom package

- ⚠️ pwndbg (reference: `Must create a custom nixpkg`)
- ⚠️ velociraptor (reference: `Must create a custom nixpkg`)
- ⚠️ falco (reference: `Must create a custom nixpkg`)
- ⚠️ cmseek (reference shows `git clone ... && uv run python3 cmseek.py`; no PyPI entry point)
- ⚠️ xsstrike (reference shows `git clone ... && uv run python xsstrike.py`; no PyPI entry point)

### Build or evaluation error

- ⚠️ evil-winrm: Ruby 3.4 LoadError, `csv` gem missing then `winrm-fs` cannot
  load. Upstream nixpkgs build is currently broken.
- ⚠️ mitm6: Python 3.13 evaluation error, `future-1.0.0` is not supported on
  the active interpreter.
- ⚠️ maigret: blocked by `python3.13-pypdf2-3.0.1` insecure marker. Requires
  `permittedInsecurePackages` override.
- ⚠️ maltego: unfree license. Requires `allowUnfree = true` and inclusion in
  `modules/meta/nixpkgs-allowed-unfree.nix`.
- ⚠️ waybackurls: marked unfree in nixpkgs. Refuses to evaluate without
  `NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1` and `--impure` (or an entry in
  `modules/meta/nixpkgs-allowed-unfree.nix`).
- ⚠️ droopescan (uvx): runtime crash, `cement 2.6.2` imports the removed
  `imp` module on Python 3.12+.
- ⚠️ patator (uvx): build of transitive `cx-oracle 8.3.0` fails, its build
  backend depends on `pkg_resources` without declaring it.
- ⚠️ python3Packages.angr: nixpkgs build fails, `setuptools-rust` missing
  from `nativeBuildInputs` during wheel preparation.
- ⚠️ dc3dd: nixpkgs compile failure with modern gcc,
  `argmatch.c:63: too many arguments to function 'usage'` (legacy macro
  mismatch).

### Binary path mismatch in the documented attribute

The package builds, but the binary referenced by the run command does not
exist (or `meta.mainProgram` is wrong).

- ⚠️ python3Packages.impacket: nixpkgs ships `secretsdump.py`, `psexec.py`,
  etc. The reference's `impacket-secretsdump` alias does not exist. Use
  `nix shell nixpkgs#python3Packages.impacket -c secretsdump.py --help`.
- ⚠️ eyewitness: derivation builds, but `bin/eye-witness` is missing inside
  the store path. `nix run` fails with `No such file or directory`.
- ⚠️ volatility3: binaries are `vol` and `volshell`, not `volatility3`. Also
  unfree, requires `NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 --impure`. Use
  `nix shell --impure nixpkgs#volatility3 -c vol --help`.
- ⚠️ ligolo-ng: package contains `ligolo-proxy` and `ligolo-agent`; no
  `ligolo-ng` binary. Use `nix shell nixpkgs#ligolo-ng -c ligolo-proxy --help`.
- ⚠️ pwntools: `meta.mainProgram` is unset, the binary is `pwn`. `nix run nixpkgs#pwntools` fails. Use `nix shell nixpkgs#pwntools -c pwn --help`.

### Documented attribute resolves to a different upstream project

- ⚠️ hayabusa: nixpkgs `hayabusa` is the IPC daemon by `koutoftimer`, not the
  Yamato Security Windows EVTX Sigma scanner. The
  `csv-timeline -d $evtx_dir -o timeline.csv` flags do not apply. Treat the
  intended forensics tool as needing a custom package.
- ⚠️ kerbrute: nixpkgs `kerbrute` resolves to impacket's Python kerbrute, not
  ropnop's Go tool. The reference's
  `kerbrute userenum -d $domain users.txt` syntax targets the ropnop binary
  and does not match the impacket CLI. The binary launches, but the
  documented command form does not.

### Documented smoke flag incompatible with the binary

- ⚠️ hash-identifier: no `--help` / `-h` support. The tool is purely
  interactive and reads HASH from stdin.
- ⚠️ python3Packages.scapy: entry point loads, but `--help` is rejected by
  scapy's own option parser (`option --help not recognized`). Use
  `python -c 'from scapy.all import *'` for verification.

### External (non-nixpkgs) toolchain blocked

- ⚠️ subjack: `go run github.com/haccer/subjack@latest` fails with
  `unknown GOEXPERIMENT synctest` against the system `go`. Works only when
  invoked through `nix shell nixpkgs#go_1_25` with `GOEXPERIMENT` unset.
  Not packaged in nixpkgs.
- ⚠️ subzy: same `unknown GOEXPERIMENT synctest` failure as subjack. Not
  packaged in nixpkgs.

### Documented uvx / PyPI invocation broken

- ⚠️ spiderfoot: `uvx --from spiderfoot sf` fails. The package is not on
  PyPI under that name (`spiderfoot-py` is also missing) and there is no
  `spiderfoot` attribute in nixpkgs. Pull from upstream git or install
  manually.
- ⚠️ scoutsuite: the package's CLI entry point is `scout`, not `scoutsuite`.
  The reference's `uvx scoutsuite` form fails. Use
  `uvx --from scoutsuite scout --help`.

### Closure fetch exceeded the smoke-test budget

- ⚠️ autopsy: 1.4 GiB closure (autopsy plus openjdk-21) did not finish
  downloading within a 20-minute budget on the test connection. Fetch is
  functional, just slow. Not a tool defect.

## Notes for the upstream reference

Run-command corrections that would prevent a future smoke run from
regressing on these entries:

- `gowitness`: replace `single -u $url` with `scan -u $url` (CLI changed in
  v3).
- `impacket`: invoke the canonical `secretsdump.py` script names rather
  than `impacket-secretsdump`.
- `volatility3`: invoke `vol` (or `volshell`) and prefix with
  `NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1` / `--impure`.
- `ligolo-ng`: use `ligolo-proxy` / `ligolo-agent` rather than the bare
  attribute.
- `pwntools`: invoke `pwn` (`nix shell nixpkgs#pwntools -c pwn --help`)
  rather than `nix run nixpkgs#pwntools`.
- `scoutsuite` (uvx): use `uvx --from scoutsuite scout ...`.
- `kerbrute`: clarify that nixpkgs ships impacket's Python kerbrute, or
  package ropnop's Go tool to match the documented command form.
- `hayabusa`: nixpkgs `hayabusa` is a different project; document the
  Yamato Security EVTX Sigma scanner as needing a custom package.
- `frp`: the package has no default app; document it as `nix shell nixpkgs#frp -c frpc -c frpc.toml` (or `frps`).
