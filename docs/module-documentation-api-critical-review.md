# NixOS Module Documentation API ‚Äì PR Status Update

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Owner:** vx

## Executive Summary

- Implementation progress is at approximately **40%**. The Worker, database schema, migrations, and Cloudflare configuration scaffolding are in place, but the project remains in MVP development.
- The architecture has been simplified to focus on **Workers + D1 + KV** with optional R2 for asset storage. Durable Objects, Vectorize, Workers AI, and other non-essential services are deferred to a later phase.
- Core API endpoints (`listModules`, `getModule`, `searchModules`, `batchUpdateModules`, `getStats`) are implemented and compile cleanly, but they have not yet been validated with live data.
- No frontend, module extraction pipeline, automated tests, or CI/CD deployments are available yet. The PR is **not production ready** until these pieces land.

## Current Scope Snapshot

### ‚úÖ Completed

- Simplified architecture and project framing focused on a lean MVP.
- `wrangler.jsonc`, setup script, and `package.json` updated with accurate bindings and TODO placeholders for environment-specific IDs.
- D1 schema, FTS5 search configuration, and migration runner implemented under `implementation/worker/migrations/`.
- Worker entry point and TypeScript handler layer implemented with routing, validation, and response helpers.
- End-to-end extraction toolchain now emits Markdown snapshots and supports optional R2 uploads (`scripts/module-docs-upload.sh`, `packages/module-docs-markdown`).

### üîÑ In Progress

- Seed R2 buckets with generated Markdown to trigger AI Search indexing; monitor ingestion status in the dashboard.
- Local end-to-end validation (requires running setup script, applying migrations, and smoke-testing endpoints).

### ‚ùå Not Started

- Frontend application under `implementation/frontend/` (planned lightweight search UI).
- Automated test suite (unit + integration + load) and coverage reporting.
- GitHub Actions pipeline for extraction uploads and Worker deployment.
- Deployment automation and environment promotion strategy.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                        | Impact                              | Mitigation                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloudflare resource IDs remain placeholders | Blocks deployment                   | Run `implementation/worker/scripts/setup.sh` and document issued IDs in `wrangler.jsonc` secrets/vars |
| Module extraction pipeline unimplemented    | API cannot ingest real data         | Prioritise building the Nix extraction script and CLI upload path before frontend work                |
| Cache invalidation strategy undefined       | Stale documentation possible        | Add KV namespace flushing utility once ingestion exists                                               |
| Rate limiting and auth simplified for MVP   | Potential abuse if exposed publicly | Keep Worker behind API key until Zero Trust integration lands                                         |

## Cost & Timeline Update

- **Estimated monthly cost at launch scale (< 10M requests):** effectively free on Cloudflare‚Äôs tiers (< $1/month including R2 storage for seed data).
- **Projected cost at 100M requests/month:** $50‚Äì100/month (Workers Unbound, D1, KV). Vector search and AI costs removed until Phase 2.

| Phase                   | Revised Duration | Status      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Infrastructure & Config | 2 days           | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Database & API Core     | 5 days           | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Module Extraction       | 5 days           | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Frontend MVP            | 5 days           | ‚è≥ Pending  |
| Tests & CI/CD           | 8 days           | ‚è≥ Pending  |
| Deployment Readiness    | 5 days           | ‚è≥ Pending  |

**Overall completion:** ~40%, **estimated time to MVP:** 3‚Äì4 weeks of focused work.

## Validation & Outstanding Work

- [x] Run `npm install` and `bash scripts/setup.sh` inside `implementation/worker/` to mint Cloudflare resources.
- [x] Apply migrations via `npm run db:migrate:local` and capture the generated IDs in project secrets.
- [x] Build the Nix module extractor and batch upload script (`implementation/nix/`).
- [x] Generate AI Search-ready Markdown snapshots and add scripted R2 upload flow.
- [ ] Implement the frontend bundle under `implementation/frontend/` with search + detail views.
- [ ] Add unit/integration tests (`npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`) and wire them into CI.
- [ ] Define deployment workflow (GitHub Actions + wrangler publish) before merging to main.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Populate the `nixos-modules-docs*` R2 buckets with the generated Markdown corpus and verify AI Search indexing completes.
2. Scaffold the frontend and basic test harness so reviewers can validate behaviour end-to-end.
3. Define the deployment workflow (GitHub Actions + wrangler publish) to unblock staging rollout.
