## Current Status

### Phase 1 (Day 1: 2025-08-10) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Backup created at: /home/vx/nixos-backups/20250810-232513
- [x] Git repository initialized (commit: b7b8fc5)
- [x] Current state analyzed (corrected methodology)
- [x] Pipe operators requirement documented
- [x] Issues documented
- Score: 72/100

### Verified State (CORRECTED):
- ✅ No literal path imports (compliant)
- ✅ Input imports present (7 - correct, should be preserved)
- ✅ nvidia-gpu has specialisation (correct pattern)
- ❌ input-branches module missing
- ❌ generation-manager tool missing
- ❌ Module headers: 107/128 modules lack formal "# Module:" header
  - Note: Only 69 start directly with code (no comments)
  - Root level: 3/8 missing headers
- ❌ 7 TODOs remaining (confirmed)
- ✅ User configuration consistent (vx)
- ✅ Git version control now active

### Phase 2 (Day 1: 2025-08-10) ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED
- [x] input-branches module implemented (+4 points) ✅ APPROVED
  - Simplified version without external flake
  - Added pipe operators in metadata
  - Documented limitations with TODOs
- [x] generation-manager tool created (+5 points) ✅ APPROVED
  - Comprehensive command set with scoring
  - Color-coded output
  - Dry-run support
  - Home Manager integration added
  - Exceeds golden standard with enhancements

### Phase 3 (Day 1: 2025-08-10) ✅ COMPLETE & REVIEWED
- [x] Module headers standardization ✅ COMPLETED WITH FIXES
  - First attempt rejected for incorrect namespaces/purposes
  - Created improved script with proper analysis
  - 107 modules updated with meaningful headers
  - Backup created at: modules.backup.headers.20250810-234932
  - Critical fixes applied after v2 review:
    - Fixed namespace truncation (pc, workstation)
    - Cleaned nvidia-gpu.nix to match golden standard exactly
    - Simplified pattern descriptions
    - Added golden standard references
    - Removed unnecessary notes
  - Score improvement: +14 points achieved
- [x] Resolve remaining TODOs ✅ COMPLETED
  - Fixed SSH host key with actual system key
  - Added dnscrypt-proxy2 service configuration  
  - Resolved tor-browser issue (available in GUI module)
  - Cleaned up mpv config (kept inline, small script)
  - Added flameshot for X11 screenshot support
  - Configured qutebrowser editor command
  - Updated ghostty and input-branches notes
  - All 7 TODOs resolved successfully

### Review Outcome:
- Score achieved: 95/100 ✅
- All critical named modules correct
- Module composition follows golden standard
- Production-ready configuration
- Minor issue: Headers slightly verbose compared to golden standard minimal approach

## Current Score: 92/100 (Per QA Deep Analysis)

### QA Deep Analysis Results (2025-08-10)
- Comprehensive review performed using ULTRATHINK mode
- Compared against golden standard (mightyiam/infra)
- Key findings:
  - Module header inconsistency (-3 points)
  - Generation manager deviation from Rust implementation (-2 points)
  - Input-branches pattern violation (-2 points)
  - DevShell complexity and emoji usage (-1 point)
- Full report: See QA_REPORT.md

## Next Steps - Phase 4 Ready
- Fix module header consistency
- Resolve input-branches pattern violation
- Address generation-manager implementation
- Remove emoji from devshell
- Review unfree packages list
- Enhance metadata organization

## Target
- Final Score: 100/100
- Timeline: 14 days
- Current Day: 1/14
- Score Progress: 72 → 76 → 81 → 92 (QA verified)
