## Booting from the install medium

To begin the installation, you have to boot your computer from the install drive.

1.  Plug in the install drive. Then turn on or restart your computer.

2.  Open the boot menu by pressing the appropriate key, which is usually shown on the display on early boot. Select the USB flash drive (the option usually contains the word “USB”). If you choose the incorrect drive, your computer will likely continue to boot as normal. In that case restart your computer and pick a different drive.

    ### Note

    The key to open the boot menu is different across computer brands and even models. It can be **F12**, but also **F1**, **F9**, **F10**, **Enter**, **Del**, **Esc** or another function key. If you are unsure and don’t see it on the early boot screen, you can search online for your computers brand, model followed by “boot from usb”. The computer might not even have that feature, so you have to go into the BIOS/UEFI settings to change the boot order. Again, search online for details about your specific computer model.

    For Apple computers with Intel processors press and hold the **⌥** (Option or Alt) key until you see the boot menu. On Apple silicon press and hold the power button.

    ### Note

    If your computer supports both BIOS and UEFI boot, choose the UEFI option. You will likely need to disable “Secure Boot” to use the UEFI option. The exact steps vary by device manufacturer but generally “Secure Boot” will be listed under “Boot”, “Security” or “Advanced” in the BIOS/UEFI menu.

    ### Note

    If you use a CD for the installation, the computer will probably boot from it automatically. If not, choose the option containing the word “CD” from the boot menu.

3.  Shortly after selecting the appropriate boot drive, you should be presented with a menu with different installer options. Leave the default and wait (or press **Enter** to speed up).

4.  The graphical images will start their corresponding desktop environment and the graphical installer, which can take some time. The minimal images will boot to a command line. You have to follow the instructions in [the section called “Manual Installation”](#sec-installation-manual "Manual Installation") there.
