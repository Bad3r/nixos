NixOS supports automatic domain validation & certificate retrieval and renewal using the ACME protocol. Any provider can be used, but by default NixOS uses Letâ€™s Encrypt. The alternative ACME client [lego](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/) is used under the hood.

Automatic cert validation and configuration for Apache and Nginx virtual hosts is included in NixOS, however if you would like to generate a wildcard cert or you are not using a web server you will have to configure DNS based validation.
