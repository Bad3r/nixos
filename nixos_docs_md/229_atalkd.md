[Basic Usage](#module-services-atalkd-basic-usage)

atalkd (AppleTalk daemon) is a component inside of the suite of software provided by Netatalk. It allows for the creation of AppleTalk networks, typically speaking over a Linux ethernet network interface, that can still be seen by classic macintosh computers. Using the NixOS module, you can specify a set of network interfaces that you wish to speak AppleTalk on, and the corresponding ATALKD.CONF(5) values to go along with it.
