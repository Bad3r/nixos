[Mailman](https://www.list.org) is free software for managing electronic mail discussion and e-newsletter lists. Mailman and its web interface can be configured using the corresponding NixOS module. Note that this service is best used with an existing, securely configured Postfix setup, as it does not automatically configure this.
