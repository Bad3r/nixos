Bootspec is a feature introduced in [RFC-0125](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/125) in order to standardize bootloader support and advanced boot workflows such as SecureBoot and potentially more. The reference implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/172237).

The creation of bootspec documents is enabled by default.
