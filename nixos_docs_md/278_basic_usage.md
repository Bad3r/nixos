## Basic Usage

By default, the module creates a [`systemd`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) unit which runs the sync server with an isolated user using the systemd `DynamicUser` option.

This can be done by enabling the `anki-sync-server` service:

```programlisting
{ ... }:

{
  services.anki-sync-server.enable = true;
}
```

It is necessary to set at least one username-password pair under `services.anki-sync-server.users`. For example

```programlisting
{
  services.anki-sync-server.users = [
    {
      username = "user";
      passwordFile = /etc/anki-sync-server/user;
    }
  ];
}
```

Here, `passwordFile` is the path to a file containing just the password in plaintext. Make sure to set permissions to make this file unreadable to any user besides root.

By default, synced data are stored in */var/lib/anki-sync-server/*ankiuser\*\*. You can change the directory by using `services.anki-sync-server.baseDirectory`

```programlisting
{ services.anki-sync-server.baseDirectory = "/home/anki/data"; }
```

By default, the server listen address `services.anki-sync-server.host` is set to localhost, listening on port `services.anki-sync-server.port`, and does not open the firewall. This is suitable for purely local testing, or to be used behind a reverse proxy. If you want to expose the sync server directly to other computers (not recommended in most circumstances, because the sync server doesnâ€™t use HTTPS), then set the following options:

```programlisting
{
  services.anki-sync-server.address = "0.0.0.0";
  services.anki-sync-server.openFirewall = true;
}
```
