## Themes

You can package custom themes and make them visible to Keycloak through [`services.keycloak.themes`](options.html#opt-services.keycloak.themes). See the [Themes section of the Keycloak Server Development Guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#_themes) and the description of the aforementioned NixOS option for more information.
