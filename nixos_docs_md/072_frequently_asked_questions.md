## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use LightDM with GNOME?

Yes you can, and any other display-manager in NixOS.

However, it doesn’t work correctly for the Wayland session of GNOME Shell yet, and won’t be able to lock your screen.

See [this issue.](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/56342)
