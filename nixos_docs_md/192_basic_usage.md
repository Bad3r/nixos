## Basic usage

A common struggle for most XMPP newcomers is to find the right set of XMPP Extensions (XEPs) to setup. Forget to activate a few of those and your XMPP experience might turn into a nightmare!

The XMPP community tackles this problem by creating a meta-XEP listing a decent set of XEPs you should implement. This meta-XEP is issued every year, the 2020 edition being [XEP-0423](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0423.html).

The NixOS Prosody module will implement most of these recommendend XEPs out of the box. That being said, two components still require some manual configuration: the [Multi User Chat (MUC)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html) and the [HTTP File Upload](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html) ones. Youâ€™ll need to create a DNS subdomain for each of those. The current convention is to name your MUC endpoint `conference.example.org` and your HTTP upload domain `upload.example.org`.

A good configuration to start with, including a [Multi User Chat (MUC)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html) endpoint as well as a [HTTP File Upload](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html) endpoint will look like this:

```programlisting
{
  services.prosody = {
    enable = true;
    admins = [ "root@example.org" ];
    ssl.cert = "/var/lib/acme/example.org/fullchain.pem";
    ssl.key = "/var/lib/acme/example.org/key.pem";
    virtualHosts."example.org" = {
      enabled = true;
      domain = "example.org";
      ssl.cert = "/var/lib/acme/example.org/fullchain.pem";
      ssl.key = "/var/lib/acme/example.org/key.pem";
    };
    muc = [ { domain = "conference.example.org"; } ];
    uploadHttp = {
      domain = "upload.example.org";
    };
  };
}
```
