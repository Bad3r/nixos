## FAQ

I have switched from a different desktop and Pantheon’s theming looks messed up.  
Open Switchboard and go to: Administration → About → Restore Default Settings → Restore Settings. This will reset any dconf settings to their Pantheon defaults. Note this could reset certain GNOME specific preferences if that desktop was used prior.

I cannot enable both GNOME and Pantheon.  
This is a known [issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/64611) and there is no known workaround.

Does AppCenter work, or is it available?  
AppCenter is available and the Flatpak backend should work so you can install some Flatpak applications using it. However, due to missing appstream metadata, the Packagekit backend does not function currently. See this [issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/15932).

If you are using Pantheon, AppCenter should be installed by default if you have [Flatpak support](#module-services-flatpak "Flatpak") enabled. If you also wish to add the `appcenter` Flatpak remote:

```programlisting
$ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists appcenter https://flatpak.elementary.io/repo.flatpakrepo
```
