[parsedmarc](https://domainaware.github.io/parsedmarc/) is a service which parses incoming [DMARC](https://dmarc.org/) reports and stores or sends them to a downstream service for further analysis. In combination with Elasticsearch, Grafana and the included Grafana dashboard, it provides a handy overview of DMARC reports over time.
