[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.

This chapter will show you how to set up your own, self-hosted Matrix homeserver using the Synapse reference homeserver, and how to serve your own copy of the Element web client. See the [Try Matrix Now!](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) overview page for links to Element Apps for Android and iOS, desktop clients, as well as bridges to other networks and other projects around Matrix.
