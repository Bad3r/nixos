[Ad-Hoc Package Management](#sec-ad-hoc-packages)

This section describes how to add additional packages to your system. NixOS has two distinct styles of package management:

- _Declarative_, where you declare what packages you want in your `configuration.nix`. Every time you run `nixos-rebuild`, NixOS will ensure that you get a consistent set of binaries corresponding to your specification.

- _Ad hoc_, where you install, upgrade and uninstall packages via the `nix-env` command. This style allows mixing packages from different Nixpkgs versions. Itâ€™s the only choice for non-root users.
