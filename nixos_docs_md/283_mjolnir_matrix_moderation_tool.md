This chapter will show you how to set up your own, self-hosted [Mjolnir](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir) instance.

As an all-in-one moderation tool, it can protect your server from malicious invites, spam messages, and whatever else you don’t want. In addition to server-level protection, Mjolnir is great for communities wanting to protect their rooms without having to use their personal accounts for moderation.

The bot by default includes support for bans, redactions, anti-spam, server ACLs, room directory changes, room alias transfers, account deactivation, room shutdown, and more.

See the [README](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir#readme) page and the [Moderator’s guide](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/main/docs/moderators.md) for additional instructions on how to setup and use Mjolnir.

For [additional settings](options.html#opt-services.mjolnir.settings) see [the default configuration](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/main/config/default.yaml).
