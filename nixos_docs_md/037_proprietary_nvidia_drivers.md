## Proprietary NVIDIA drivers

NVIDIA provides a proprietary driver for its graphics cards that has better 3D performance than the X.org drivers. It is not enabled by default because itâ€™s not free software. You can enable it as follows:

```programlisting
{ services.xserver.videoDrivers = [ "nvidia" ]; }
```

If you have an older card, you may have to use one of the legacy drivers:

```programlisting
{
  hardware.nvidia.package = config.boot.kernelPackages.nvidiaPackages.legacy_470;
  hardware.nvidia.package = config.boot.kernelPackages.nvidiaPackages.legacy_390;
  hardware.nvidia.package = config.boot.kernelPackages.nvidiaPackages.legacy_340;
}
```

You may need to reboot after enabling this driver to prevent a clash with other kernel modules.
