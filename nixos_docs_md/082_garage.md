[Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/) is an open-source, self-hostable S3 store, simpler than MinIO, for geodistributed stores. The server setup can be automated using [services.garage](options.html#opt-services.garage.enable). A client configured to your local Garage instance is available in the global environment as `garage-manage`.
