Crab-hole is a cross platform Pi-hole clone written in Rust using [hickory-dns/trust-dns](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns). It can be used as a network wide ad and spy blocker or run on your local PC.

For a secure and private communication, crab-hole has builtin support for DoH(HTTPS), DoQ(QUIC) and DoT(TLS) for down- and upstreams and DNSSEC for upstreams. It also comes with privacy friendly default logging settings.
