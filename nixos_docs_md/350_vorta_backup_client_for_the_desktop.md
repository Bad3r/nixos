## Vorta backup client for the desktop

Vorta is a backup client for macOS and Linux desktops. It integrates the mighty BorgBackup with your desktop environment to protect your data from disk failure, ransomware and theft.

It can be installed in NixOS e.g. by adding `pkgs.vorta` to [`environment.systemPackages`](options.html#opt-environment.systemPackages).
